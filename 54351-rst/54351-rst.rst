They were having a dance over in Beaver
Cove, at the Woods'.  All the young people
of the settlement were there, and many from
adjoining settlements.  The main room of the
cabin had been almost cleared of its meager
furniture, and the pine-plank floor creaked
under the tread of shuffling feet, while dust and
lamp-smoke made the atmosphere thick and
close.

But little did the dancers care for that.  Bill
Eldridge sat by the hearth, playing his fiddle
with tireless energy, while a boy added the
thumping of two straws to the much-tried
fiddle-strings.  A party of shy girls huddled in a
corner of the room, and the bashful boys hung
about the door, and talked loudly.

"Hey, there! git yer partners!" Bill cried
to them tauntingly from time to time.

Armindy Hudgins and Elisha Cole were
pre-eminently the leaders in the party.  They
danced together again and again; they sat on
the bench in the dooryard; they walked to the
spring for a fresh draught of water.  Armindy
was the coquette of the settlement.  In beauty,
in spirit, and in daring, no other girl in Beaver
Cove could compare with her.  She could plow
all day and dance half the night without losing
her peachy bloom, and it was generally
admitted that she could take her choice of the
marriageable young men of the settlement.  But
she laughed at all of them by turns, until her
lovers dwindled down to two—Elisha Cole and
Ephraim Hurd.  They were both desperately
in earnest, and their rivalry had almost broken
their lifelong friendship.  She favored first one
and then the other, but to-night she showed
such decided preference for Cole that Hurd felt
hatred filling his heart.  He did not dance at
all, but hung about the door, or walked moodily
up and down the yard, savage with jealousy.
Armindy cast many mocking glances at him,
but seemed to feel no pity for his suffering.

In the middle of the evening, while they
were yet fresh, she and Elisha danced the
"hoe-down."  All the others crowded back against
the walls, leaving the middle of the room clear,
and she and her partner took their places.
They were the best dancers in the settlement,
and Beaver Cove could boast of some as good
as any in all north Georgia.  The music struck
up, and the two young people began slowly to
shuffle their feet, advancing toward each other,
then retreating.  They moved at first without
enthusiasm, gravely and coolly.  The music
quickened, and their steps with it.  Now
together, now separate, up and down the room,
face to face, advancing, receding, always in
that sliding, shuffling step.  The girl's face
flushed; her lithe figure, clothed in the most
primitively fashioned blue print gown, swayed
and curved in a thousand graceful movements;
her feet, shod in clumsy brogans, moved so
swiftly one could scarcely follow them; her
yellow hair slipped from its fastenings and fell
about her neck and shoulders; her bosom
heaved and palpitated.  Panting and breathless,
Elisha dropped into a seat, his defeat greeted
with jeering laughter by the crowd, while
Armindy kept the floor.  It was a wild, half-savage
dance, and my pen refuses to describe it.
Nowhere, except in the mountains of north
Georgia, have I ever witnessed such a strange
performance.

Armindy would not stop until, half-blind and
reeling with exhaustion, she darted toward the
door, amid the applause of the crowd.  Elisha
Cole started up to follow her, but Ephraim Hurd
reached her side first, and went out into the
yard with her.

"You've nearly killed yourself," he said,
half-roughly, half-tenderly.

"No such a thing!" she retorted.

"You're out o' breath now."

"I want some water."

"Better sit down on this bench and rest a
minute first," he said, attempting to lead her to
a seat placed under an apple-tree; but she broke
away from him, running swiftly toward the
spring bubbling up from a thicket of laurel just
beyond the dooryard fence.

"I ain't no baby, Eph'um Hurd!" she cried,
gathering up her hair and winding it about her
head again, the breeze fanning her flushed
cheeks.

The moon was clear and full over Brandreth's
Peak, and Ephraim looked up at it, then down
on the girl, softened, etherealized by its magic
beams.

"What makes you act so, Armindy?"

She broke a spray of laurel bloom and thrust
it through the coil of her hair.

"I don't know what you're talkin' about,
Eph'um; but I do know I'm waitin' for you to
give me that gourd o' water."

He sighed, stooped, and filled the gourd to
the brim, and gave it to her.  She drank deeply,
then threw the remainder out in a glittering
shower, and dropped the gourd into the spring.

"Don't go to the house yet," he pleaded, as
she turned away.

"I'm tired."

"An' I—I am—you don't keer anything for
'Lishy, do you?  Armindy, do you recollect
what you said the last time we went to the
singin' at Rock Creek?"

She looked at him from under her lashes,
half smiled, then said:

"I don't recollect anything perticular."

"I do," he muttered softly, and stepped
across the spring-run to her side.  "You
said—"

"Oh, don't tell me!—I don't mean anything
I say!" she hastily cried.

His face clouded with jealous anger again;
he laid his hand on her shoulder.

"You'll—make me do somethin' turrible,
Armindy, if you don't mind.  I love you;
don't—don't—treat me like a dog, flingin'
crumbs to me one day, an' whippin' me off
the next."

She pushed away his hand, for, with all her
coquetries, no man dared take any liberties
with her, and stepped beyond his reach.

"I ain't done nuthin' to you, Eph'um Hurd.  I—"

"You have!" he cried, stamping his feet;
"you've made me love you, tell I don't feel as
I could live without you; you let me think that
you loved—"

"Law! what's the use o' listenin' to a girl's
foolishness?  Maybe I love you; an', ag'in,
maybe I love 'Lishy Cole an' a dozen others.
You're too set on havin' your own way," she
exclaimed with a loud laugh.

Somebody called to her from the fence.

"That's 'Lishy, now."

"An' you're goin' to him?" said Ephraim
with a pale face.

"Yes, I'm goin' to him.  He don't bemean
me," with a pretense of being aggrieved, but
with mocking laughter in her eyes.

She ran up to the fence, and he heard her
talking to Elisha about the flowers in her hair.

The party was over.  Ephraim Hurd could
scarcely contain the violence of his rage when
Armindy refused his company home to accept
Elisha Cole's.  And how hurt he felt, as well
as angry!  The slight cut to his soul.  He
watched them as they went away with a party
of the neighbors; he listened to their
conversation and loud laughter, until the maddening
sound of it was lost in the distance; then he
mounted his mule and rode swiftly through the
Cove down toward the town on the banks of
the Cartecay River, where revenue-officers
were stationed.  A fierce, irresistible temptation
had assailed—had conquered him.  If he could
not have love, he could have revenge.  The
revenue-men would be glad to know where
Elisha Cole concealed his distillery; they would
be better pleased to get Elisha himself.  Just
a hint, scrawled and unsigned, would be
sufficient for them, and no one need know who had
furnished the information.

.. vspace:: 2

It was morning, full daylight, with mists and
clouds afloat in the upper rays of the yet
invisible sun, when Ephraim Hurd forded Rock
Creek on his way home.  The jaded mule dipped
his steaming nostrils in the cool, fast-flowing
stream, drank thirstily, then, coming out,
stopped to crop the high, tender grass growing
by the roadside.  Ephraim let the rein fall
loosely on the faithful creature's neck, while
his dull eyes wandered over the landscape.  He
looked haggard; and the chilly, invigorating
air made him shiver, instead of infusing fresh
life into him.  He dismounted to tighten the
girth, then leaned his arm on the saddle,
seemingly forgetting to pursue his way home.  He
was tall, and held himself unusually erect for a
mountaineer.  He had a rather fine face, with
soft, dark beard on lip and chin, and his eyes
were a deep, serene blue.  He did not look like
a coward or a traitor, and yet he secretly felt
that he could be justly called so; for repentance
had followed quickly upon his rash betrayal
of his friend.

The night would have seemed only like a
bad dream—a nightmare, had he not gone on
that journey to Buckhorn, stealing like a thief
through the sleeping town, to slip that line of
information under the door of the court-room,
where it would be found by the revenue-officers
the first thing in the morning.  Viewed in the
clear, cold light of the morning, when jealousy
and savage anger had spent themselves, the
deed appeared base to the last degree.  He
passed his hand over his face with a sense of
deepest shame.  According to the mountaineer's
code of honor, a man could not do a
meaner, more contemptible thing, than to
betray a comrade to the revenue-men.  He would
fare better as a thief or a vagabond.  No
wonder Ephraim Hurd felt like hiding his face from
the clear accusing light! no wonder he groaned
in anguish of soul!  He had lost his own
self-respect; he had forfeited all right to the trust
of his neighbors.

He raised his eyes and looked slowly around
again, and, with his mental faculties all
quickened by the trouble he was in, he seemed to
realize the preciousness of freedom.  A
perception of the wild, primeval beauty of the world
around thrilled him.  He looked up at the
cloud floating over the deep blue of the sky,
tinged with the rose-light of sunrise; at the
fog-wreaths curling around the summits of the
higher mountains; at the green depths of the
forests; at the winding streams, bordered by
laurel and rhododendron, rushing in sparkling
cascades or lying in clear, silent pools.  All
the ineffable loveliness and charm of the new
world—the new day, penetrated his soul.  The
deep solitude, broken only by the murmur of
the streams, and the liquid, melancholy notes
of the hermit thrush, influenced him as it never
had before.  Think of leaving it all for the
court-room, and the prison!  Think of languishing
within four close walls through sultry days
and restless nights!

Pity for the man he had betrayed melted his
heart.  At this moment how slight seemed the
provocation!  Elisha Cole had as much right
to Armindy's favor as he could claim.

On the upper side of Rock Creek, just under
the great cliff rising boldly toward the clouds,
a clump of laurel bushes in full bloom hung
over the stream, the opening buds a fine
delicate pink, the wide-opened flowers faded to
dull white.  Ephraim's eyes fell on them, and
his face contracted with a keen thrill of pain as
he remembered Armindy standing by the spring
in the moonlight, and fastening a spray of
laurel in her hair.  Flushed from the dance,
radiant with triumph, she had no thought for
him—no kind words.  Nevertheless, his heart
softened toward her; he writhed as he thought
of the sorrow he had laid up for her.  He had
lost account of time in the midst of his bitter
reflections, and a sun-ray, striking across his
face, startled him.  He sprang into the
saddle, and rode out of the highway into the
settlement road leading through Beaver Cove.

The Hudgins lived on that road, at the foot
of Bush Mountain, in an old log-cabin built in
the "double-pen" fashion, with an open entry,
and in the rear a rude kitchen.  Below the
house lay a freshly cleared field, the fence
skirting the roadside, and as he drew near,
Ephraim heard Armindy singing an old
baptismal hymn in a high, clear voice, making
abrupt little pauses to say "Gee!" or "Haw!"
or "Get up there!" to the ox she was driving
before the plow.

Last night she danced the "hoe-down" with
spirit and grace, the belle of the party; to-day
she plowed in her father's corn-field, barefooted,
and clothed in a faded homespun gown, singing
for the mere joy of existence—of conscious
life.  She had on a deep sunbonnet, and coarse
woolen gloves covered her hands—strong,
supple hands, grasping the plow-handles like
a man's.

She reached the end of the row just as
Ephraim drew near, and looked over the fence
at him with a smile and a blush.

"Good mornin', Eph'um," she cried in a
conciliatory tone.  "You look as if you had been
out all night."

"I have."

"Law! what for?  At the 'stillery?"  Her
voice dropped to a softer key.

"No."

She looked attentively at his sad, haggard
face, then took off her bonnet and fanned herself.

"Are you mad at me, Eph'um?"

"No; I ain't mad now, Armindy."

"Then what makes you look so—so strange?"

"I was mad last night."

She turned the cool loam of the freshly
opened furrow over her naked feet, a faint
smile lurking in the corners of her mouth.  He
saw it, but did not feel angry.

"Good-by, Armindy," he said gently.

"I didn't mean anythin' last night, Eph'um,"
she said hastily, sobered again by the gravity
of his voice and manner.

"I know how it was."

"I don't believe you do.  I—"  But he rode
away while the defensive little speech remained
unfinished on her lips.

She looked after him, slowly replacing the
bonnet on her head.

"He is mad, or somethin's happened.  I
never seed him look like he does this mornin'."

She turned the ox into another furrow, but
stepped silently behind the plow.  She sang
no more that morning.

Beaver Cove was really a long, narrow valley,
shut in by ranges of high mountains, the
serried peaks sharply outlined against the sky on
clear days.  The mountain-sides were broken
into deep ravines, and here and there, near the
base, rose sheltered nooks, in which the
mountaineers dwelt, cultivating patches and eking
out a primitive livelihood with game and fish.
It was in one of these retreats that Ephraim
Hurd and his mother lived, with all the length
and breadth of the valley lying below them,
and the mountains overshadowing them above.

As Ephraim turned from the main settlement
road into the wilder trail leading up to his
house he met met Elisha Cole driving a yoke
of oxen.  He was whistling a dance-tune, and
hailed Ephraim with a cheerful, friendly air, his
whole manner betraying a suppressed exultation.
Ephraim noticed it quickly, and clenched
his hand on the switch he held—that manner
said so plainly, "I have won her; I can afford
to be friendly with you now."

"Just gittin' home?" he inquired with a jocular air.

"Yes."

"Oh, ho!  Which one o' the Wood girls is
it, 'Mandy, or Sary Ann?"

Ephraim flushed, but let the rude joke pass.

"Where are you goin'?"

"To the sawmill for a load o' lumber."

"Goin' to build?"

"Yes; in the fall."

"Thinkin' o' marryin', I s'pose?"

"You've hit it plumb on the head, Eph'um.
I am thinkin' o' that very thing," he said, with
a loud, joyous laugh.

It grated on the miserable Ephraim.  He was
full of one thought, which he repeated over and
over to himself, "To-morrow he'll be in prison,
an' Armindy'll be cryin' her eyes out."

"You'll not be at the 'stillery to-night?" he
inquired stammeringly.

"Yes, I will.  Man alive, what ails you, Eph'um?"

"Nothin'—nothin'.  Hadn't you better go to
see Armindy?"

Elisha eyed him suspiciously.

"Me an' Armindy understand one another,"
he said roughly.

Ephraim rode on, his guilty conscience
forbidding any more conversation.  He longed to
give Elisha a hint of approaching danger—to
say carelessly, "I hear the raiders'll be out
tonight;" but he knew that he could not without
betraying the whole truth.

Breakfast awaited him, and his mother sat in
the doorway, smoking, when he arrived at
home—a homely woman, yellow as saffron, wrinkled
as parchment, and without a tooth in her
mouth.  Her face lighted up at the sight of her
son, and she knocked the ashes from her pipe.
He had been a good son, a steady boy, and his
absence alarmed her.

"Law! but this is a relief!" she cried as he
came in after caring for the mule.  "I didn't
know you 'lowed to stay out all night."

"I didn't, neither, when I left home."

"I was pestered, thinkin' o' the raiders.
Anythin' happened to you?"

"Nothin', mother."

"Are you sick?"

"No."

She watched him silently while he ate sparingly
of the breakfast.  His dull eyes, his haggard
face made her anxious.  He had no appetite;
he plainly did not care to talk.  Her
suspicions fell on Armindy Hudgins as the cause
of his dejection.  She began to question him
about the party.  She mentioned Armindy and
Elisha Cole several times, and each time he
betrayed some feeling.  She felt resentful
toward the girl.

"I s'pose Armindy had things her own way
las' night?"

"Purty much."

"I don't, for the life o' me, see why you all
should be crazy about that girl.  Now 'Mandy
or Sary Ann Wood, or Betsey—"

"Ugly as crows, all of 'em."

"Well, they may n't be as purty as pictur's,
but they are a sight better than Armindy Hudgins,"
she retorted, indignantly.

"They certainly ain't smarter, mother."

"No; I s'pose they ain't, for work," said
Mrs. Hurd, reluctantly; "but principles count for
somethin', Eph'um—you'll 'low that."

"Yes; yes," he cried, and hastily left the
table.  Who could show less principle than he had?

He went out to work, hoeing and thinning
the young corn in a field he had cleared on the
mountain-side, but the vigor had gone out of
him with hope and courage.  The sunlight
dazed him, and after a while he stopped and
leaned upon his hoe, looking down into the
valley, his eyes following the cloud-shadows
sweeping silently over the fields, blotting out
the silvery gleam of Beaver Creek.  It was a day
of strange, conflicting thoughts.  He had never
passed through such an experience in all his
simple, primitive life.  The impressions of the
morning lingered in his memory through the
heat of the languid noon and the soft decline
of the evening.  He had brought upon himself
a great question of right and wrong—at least it
seemed great to him; so great he could scarcely
grapple with it, or settle it with wisdom and
justice.

After a supper, partaken almost in silence,
he took down his gun and carefully loaded it.
Mrs. Hurd watched him until he picked up his
hat; then she anxiously inquired:

"Where are you goin', Eph'um?"

"Down to the 'stillery."

"It 'pears to me you'd better take some rest."

"I will, later."

"Well, do be keerful an' keep an eye out for
the raiders.  I've been so oneasy an' pestered
to-day that I feel mighty like somethin's goin'
to happen."

He went out, but turned on the doorstep to
speak to her:

"If anythin' does happen, mother, you'll be
prepared for it."

She sighed, and her wrinkled face quivered
with emotion.

"I'm always prepared for the worst, an'
expectin' it.  To have some sort o' dread on your
mind 'pears to me to be a part o' life."

Ephraim shouldered his gun, and disappeared
in the darkness.  He followed the road for a
short distance, then turned out into a trail
leading over a ridge.  It was not easy walking, but
the sure-footedness and agility that are a
birthright of the mountaineer made it easy for him.

Out of the deep, clear sky overhead the
stars shone softly, but afar in the northwest
lay great masses of clouds.  Constant flashes
of lightning shot over them, and through the
profound silence came the dull mutterings of
thunder.  It was a good time for the raiders to
be abroad, and the thought quickened Ephraim's
steps.  He felt sure they would come
before moonrise.  On the other side of the
ridge he traversed a wilder region of country.
Half an hour's rapid walking brought him to a
small clearing, surrounded by a low rail-fence.
In the centre of the clearing stood a cabin, a
stream of ruddy light pouring from its open
door.  It was where the Coles lived.  Two
fierce hounds greeted Ephraim's approach with
loud, hostile barking, and when he called out
to them a young woman appeared at the door
with a child on her breast—Elisha Cole's sister-in-law.

"Any o' the men folks at home, Mis' Cole?"
Ephraim inquired, leaning over the fence.

"No; John an' his pap have gone over to
Fannin County, an' 'Lishy's just started to the
'stillery."

"Oh!—just started, you say?"

"Yes; he ain't been gone five minutes.
Won't you come in, Eph'um?"

"Not to-night, Mis' Cole.  I 'lowed I'd see
'Lishy before he got off."

With a brief good-night he turned away,
following a trail leading down through a ravine.
It was a wild, lonely way, and so dark that one
could scarcely see an inch ahead.  But the
pathway presently took an upward turn, and the
gray starlight penetrated the sparse underbush.
He heard the snapping of twigs ahead of him,
and whistled softly.  Then the sound of stealthy
footsteps fell upon his alert ears.  He ran
forward a few paces, not daring to speak; then
he stumbled over the prostrate body of a man.

"'Lishy," he whispered, peering into the
upturned face.

"Is it you, Eph'um?"

"Yes; what's the matter?"

"The raiders they tied me; they're lookin'
for Jed Bishop."

It was the work of an instant for Ephraim to
get out his knife and to cut the thongs binding
Elisha's hands and feet.  But the prostrate man
had not scrambled up before the revenue-officers
were down upon them again.  Ephraim
snatched his gun, and leaped between Elisha
and his foes.

"Get out of the way if you can!" he cried to
his friend, and fired blindly at the officers.

Early the next morning, as Armindy sat
on the entry steps engaged in sewing some
patchwork together before the out-door
occupations of the day began, a neighbor rode up
and hailed her father.

"Heard about the raid last night?"

"No!" exclaimed Mr. Hudgins, hastening to
the fence.  "Who'd they get?"

"Nobody but Eph'um Hurd."

Armindy dropped her work, her face growing
white, her lower lip caught between her clenched teeth.

"It seems they'd caught 'Lishy Cole, an'
was lookin' for Jed Bishop, when Eph'um come
up an' set 'Lishy free again.  He hadn't more'n
done it when up come the raiders, an' 'Lishy
says Eph'um fit like old Satan hisself, shootin'
at 'em tell 'Lishy cleared out."

"Well, well! that does beat all!  He'd better
'a' looked out for hisself."

"That's what I say, an' he with his ma to
look after.  He wounded one o' the officers,
an' it's bound to go hard with him.  You
needn't look so skeered, Armindy"—raising
his voice and looking over at the girl, "'Lishy's
safe."

"Oh, yes; 'Lishy's safe.  I'm only thinkin'
o' what might 'a' happened to him."  She
laughed loudly, then gathered up her work and
rushed into the house.

With slow, uncertain steps a man walked
along the settlement road through Beaver Cove.
His clothes hung loosely from his slightly
stooping shoulders; he leaned on a stick.  All
about him were the joyful influences of spring.
The mountains were clothed in palest green,
and every stream could boast its share of laurel
and rhododendron abloom along its banks.
The man drew in deep breaths of the fine air;
his eyes wandered lingeringly over scenes
familiar, yet long unvisited.  Once he stooped
and drank from a clear, shallow stream purling
along the road, and, drawing his sleeve across
his mouth, muttered softly:

"Ah, that's good.  I ain't drunk nothin' like
it in more'n four years."

He sat down on a fallen tree rotting on the
roadside, to rest a few minutes.  A market-wagon,
white-covered and drawn by a yoke of
sleek oxen, rumbled down the hill.  In the
driver the wayfarer recognized an old neighbor.

"Howdy, Mr. Davis?"

Davis stared, then leaped from the wagon.

"Why—why—it's Eph'um Hurd, ain't it?"

"What's left o' him," said Ephraim, rising,
and shaking hands with his old friend.

"Well, you do look used up an' peaked."

"I've been sick."

"An' your hair is gray."

"It's the prison life done it."

"You've been through a good deal, I take
it," in a tone of compassion.

"I don't want to think o' it any more if I can
help it!" Ephraim exclaimed.  "They didn't
treat me so bad, but—oh, I thought it would
take the soul out o' me!"

Davis shook his head sympathetically.

Ephraim's face sank on his breast for a
moment.  There were some questions he longed,
yet dreaded, to ask.  At last he plucked up
courage.

"How—how is mother?"

"Purty well."

"'Lishy Cole is married, is he?"

"Yes; he married more 'n two years ago."

Of course he had expected that answer, but
it caused his thin, worn face to twitch and
contract with pain.  He hastily picked up his
stick.

"I—I'd better be gittin' on."

"Your ma's moved down to the Wood
place," his neighbor called after him as he
started up the road.  "The Woods moved to
Fannin County last year, you know."

"Is that so?" said Ephraim, but without
halting again.

Married!  Yes, why should they not marry?
It was for that he had saved Elisha Cole.  He
had known it from the night of the dance, had
clearly foreseen it all, that morning he stopped
at Rock Creek—facing the awakening world
and his own conscience.  He had struggled for
resignation during his prison life, but never had
he been able to think of Armindy sitting by
Elisha Cole's fireside—Elisha Cole's wife—without
the fiercest pang of jealous anguish.

He sat down again, trembling with exhaustion,
and bared his throbbing head to the cool
breeze.  He looked at his long, thin hands,
stroked his face, feeling the hollows in his
cheeks and under his eyes.  He would never
get back his youth and vigor again.  It was
well no woman loved him except his mother.
She would not criticise his changed appearance,
or care less for him on account of it.

It was dusk when he reached the old Wood
cabin.  The shutters had not been drawn over
the small, square window in the chimney-corner,
and he crept across the yard to look into
the room, himself unseen.  A low fire burned
on the hearth; he could smell the bread
baking before it, and the smoke of frying bacon
filled the room.  Then he saw his mother
sitting at the corner of the hearth knitting, while
another woman stooped over the fire.  Suddenly
she stood erect, and he caught his breath
sharply, for it was Armindy Hudgins, Elisha
Cole's wife, flushed, handsomer than ever.
What did it mean?  Had they taken his mother
to live with them?  He writhed at the thought.
He leaned forward, for Armindy was speaking:

"Now I'll step to the spring for a pail o'
water; then we'll have supper."

"I wish Eph'um was here to eat it with us.
Do you think he'll ever come, Armindy?"
she said wistfully.

"I know he will," said Armindy, firmly; but
a shadow fell upon her face, and Ephraim could
see that she looked older, more serious, than in
former days.  But what a fine, elastic step she
had! what supple curves in her figure!  His
eyes dwelt upon her with admiration, with
despair.  He loved her as deeply as ever.  She
stepped out of the room and went away to the
spring.  He followed her, determined to find
out the cause of her presence in his mother's
house.

He vividly remembered that other night
when they stood at the spring together, and
raised his eyes to Brandreth's Peak, but the
moon hung low in the west, a pale crescent,
Armindy knelt by the spring, dipping up the
water, when his shadow came between her and
the faint moonlight.  She glanced up, then
sprang to her feet, half-frightened; the next
moment she ran to him and fell weeping on his
neck.

"Eph'um!  Eph'um!  I said you'd come!
I've always said you'd come!"

He gathered her to him; then tried to push
her away.

"Don't—I—where is 'Lishy?" he stammered.

"I don't know.  What do you want to think
o' him for, now?" she cried, looking at him
with wet eyes, drawing his face down to hers.

"Ain't you 'Lishy's wife?"

She fell back a little.

"Did you think I'd marry him?  I loved
you, Eph'um—you."

"Is that the reason you 're here with my
mother?"

"Yes; I've been with her nearly all the time."

"It was my fault the raiders come out to get
'Lishy, that night."

"I knew it when I heard how you saved him
from them.  Oh, don't hate me for makin' you
suffer so!  It seemed like fun then, but I've
been paid back for it all."

He felt dazed.  Armindy free, Armindy faithful,
and loving, and humbly entreating him not
to hate her!  Life thrilled afresh through him.

"Who did 'Lishy Cole marry?" he inquired
at last.

"How you keep thinkin' o' him!"

"I can afford to now."

"He married Sary Ann Wood."

They were standing by the laurel thicket.
She saw that his eyes were fixed on the
flowers, and turned quickly away to take up the
pail of water.

"I ain't danced the hoe-down since that
night."

He broke off a spray of the flowers and
fastened it in her hair.

The Standneges lived in a little sheltered
cove upon the mountain-side, their house only
a two-roomed cabin, with an entry separating
the rooms, and low, ungainly chimneys at each
end.  Below it the Cartecay River lay like an
amber ribbon in the green, fertile valley; above
it towered majestic mountain heights, shrouded
in silver mists or veiled in a blue haze.  The
Standneges were bred-and-born mountaineers,
and had drifted into the little cove while Indian
camp-fires were still glowing like stars in the
valley of the Cartecay, and Indian wigwams
dotting the river's banks.  The house had a
weather-beaten look, and the noble chestnut-oaks
shading it had covered the roof with a fine
green mold.

The kitchen, a heavy-looking, smoke-blackened
structure with a puncheon floor, stood
just in the rear of the house, and so situated
that from the door one could look through the
entry to the front gate and the mountain road
beyond.

Mrs. Standnege sat in the kitchen door one
morning with bottles and bean-bags scattered
around her, "sortin'" out seed-beans.  She was
a woman not much beyond middle age, but
lean and yellow, with faded eyes and scant
dun-colored hair, time and toil and diet having
robbed her of the last remnant of youth,
without giving her a lovely old age.  She was a
good type of the average mountain woman,
illiterate but independent, and contented with
her scant homespun dress, her house, her beanbags.

   MRS. STANDNEGE.

A heavy old loom occupied one corner of the
kitchen, and Polly, the eldest daughter, sat on
the high bench before it, industriously weaving,
while S'phiry Ann stood by the smoke-stained
mantel, watching the pine she had laid on the
fire burst into vivid flame.  A bundle of clothes
lay at her feet, surmounted by a round flat
gourd, filled with brown jelly-like soap.

Polly was the eldest and she the youngest of
eight children, but the others all lay safely and
peacefully in the little neglected burial-ground
at the foot of the mountain.  She was unlike
mother and sister.  She had youth, she was
supple and fair, her hair dark and abundant,
her eyes gray and clear.  She had the soft,
drawling voice, but also a full share of the
sturdy independence, of her race.  The
circumstances of her christening, Mrs. Standnege was
rather fond of relating.

"Yes, S'phiry Ann is er oncommon name,"
she would say, not without a touch of
complacency, "but her pap give it tu her.  She was a
month old to a day, when that travelin' preacher
come through here an' held meetin' fer brother
Dan'l on Sunday.  He preached mos'ly about
them liars droppin' dead at the 'postles' feet,
an' Standnege came home all but persessed
about it, an' nothin' ed do but he mus' name
the baby S'phiry Ann instead er Sary Ann as
we had thought.  He 'lowed it sarved them
onprincipled folks right to die, an' he wanted
somethin' ter remin' him o' that sermont.  Well,
I ain't desputin' but it was right, but I tole
Standnege then, an' I say so yit, that ef all
the liars in the world war tuk outen it, thar
wouldn't be many folks left."

S'phiry Ann had heard of the fate of the
Sapphira figuring in sacred history; it had been
deeply impressed on her mind in her tenderest
years, and might possibly have left a good
impression, for she grew up a singularly truthful,
upright girl.  Just now, as she leaned against
the mantel and stared at the fire, her face wore
an unwontedly grave expression.

"Folks as set themselves up ter be better'n
they ekals air mighty apt tu git tuk down,
S'phiry Ann," said her mother, evidently
resuming a conversation dropped a short time
before.

"But I ain't a-settin' up ter be better'n my
ekals, ma," said S'phiry Ann, gently but defensively.

"It 'peared like nothin' else yiste'day when
you so p'intedly walked away from Gabe Plummer
at meetin', an' it the fust time you had seed
him since comin' from yer aunt Thomas over in
Boondtown settle*mint*.  Thar ain't no call ter
treat Gabe so."

"But ain't we hearn he's tuk up with them
distillers on the mountains?" said the girl in a
low tone, a deep flush overspreading her face.

"Yes, we hev hearn it, but what o' that?
Many a gal has tuk jes' sech."

"An' glad to get 'em, too," snapped Polly
sharply, stopping to tie up a broken thread.

"Gabe Plummer is er oncommon steddy
boy.  He's er master hand at en'thing he wants
ter do, an'—"

But S'phiry Ann did not linger to hear the
full enumeration of her lover's virtues.  Hastily
balancing the bundle of clothes on her head,
she took up the blazing torch, and hurried to
the spring, a crystal-clear stream, running out
of a ledge of rock, and slipping away through
a dark ravine to the river.  If she imagined
she had escaped all reproaches for her
reprehensible conduct the day before, it was a sad
mistake.  Hardly had the fire been kindled
and the rusty iron kettle filled with water when
a young man came treading heavily through
the laurel thicket above the spring, leaped
down the crag, and saluted her.

"Mornin', S'phiry Ann."

"Mornin', Gabe," she said, blushing vividly
and busying herself piling unnecessary fuel on
the fire.

   MR. STANDNEGE.

He was a fine specimen of the mountaineer,
lithe, well-made, toughened to hardy endurance,
with tawny hair falling to his collar, and
skin bronzed to a deep brown.  He wore no
coat, and his shirt was homespun, his nether
garments of coarse brown jeans.  He carried a
gun, and a shot-bag and powder-horn were
slung carelessly across his shoulders.

"I knowed you had a way er washin' on
Monday, so I jest thought bein' as I was out
a-huntin' I'd come roun'," he said, sitting down
on the wash-bench, and laying the gun across
his lap.

"You air welcome," she said, taking a tin
pail and stepping to the spring to fill it.

"I wouldn't 'a' lowed so from yiste'day,"
darting a reproachful glance at her.

She made no reply.

"What made you do it, S'phiry Ann?" he
exclaimed, no longer able to restrain himself.
"I ain't desarved no sech; but if it was jes' ter
tease me, why—"

She arose with the pail of water.

"No, it wasn't that," she said in a low tone,
her eyes downcast, the color flickering
uncertainly in her face.

"Then you didn't mean what was said that
night a-comin' from the Dillin'ham gatherin',"
he cried, turning a little pale.  "Mebby it's
somebody over in Boondtown settlement," a
smoldering spark of jealousy flaming up.

"It's the 'stillery, Gabe," she said, and
suddenly put down the pail to unburden her
trembling hands.  "You hadn't ought ter go
inter it."

"But the crap last year made a plum' failure,"
he replied excusingly, his eyes shifting
slightly under the light of hers.  She was
standing by the spring, against a background of dark
green, a slanting sunbeam shifting its gold down
through the overhanging pine on her dark,
uncovered head, lighting up her earnest face,
lending lustrous fire to her eyes.  The scant
cotton skirt and ill-fitting bodice she wore
could not destroy the supple grace of her
figure, molded for strength as well as beauty.

"The crap wusn't no excuse, an' if you mus'
make whiskey up thar on the sly, I ain't no
more tu say, an' I ain't no use fer ye."

"Yer mean it, S'phiry Ann?"

"I mean it, Gabe."

"Then you never keered," he cried with
rising passion, "an' that half-way promise ter
marry me was jest a lie ter fool me—nothin' but
a lie, I'll make it if I please," bringing his
down on the bench with a fierce blow.

"An' hide in the caves like a wild creetur,
when the raiders air out on mountains?"
she scornfully exclaimed.

   GABE AND S'PHIRY ANN.

His sunburned face flushed a dull red, he
writhed under the cruel question.

"They ain't apt ter git me, that's certain," he
muttered.

"You don't know that," more gently.  "Think
o' Al Hendries an' them Fletcher boys.  They
thought themselves too smart for the officers,
but they wasn't.  You know how they was
caught arter lyin' out for weeks, a-takin'
sleet an' rain an' all but starvin', an' tuk
ter Atlanty an' put in jail, an' thar they staid
a-pinin'.  I staid 'long er Al's wife them days,
for she was that skeery she hated ter see night
come, an' I ain't forgot how she walked the
floor a-wringin' her hands, or settin' bent over
the fire a-dippin' snuff or a-smokin'—'twas all
the comfort she had—an' the chilluns axin' for
their pap, an' she not a-knowin' if he'd ever git
back.  Oh! 'twas turrible lonesome—-plum'
heart-breakin' to the poor creetur.  Then one
day, 'long in the spring, Al crep' in, all broke
down an' no 'count.  The life gave outen him,
an' for a while he sot roun' an' tried ter pick up,
but the cold an' the jail had their way, an' he
died."

She poured out the brief but tragic story
breathlessly, then paused, looked down, and
then up again.  "Gabe, I sez ter myself then,
'None o' that in your'n, S'phiry Ann, none o'
that in your'n.'"

She raised the bucket and threw its contents
into a tub.

Gabe Plummer cast fiery glances at her, the
spirit and firmness she displayed commanding
his admiration, even while they filled him with
rage against her.  Yes, he knew Al Hendries's
story; he distinctly remembered the fury of
resentment his fate roused among his comrades,
the threats breathed against the law, but he
held himself superior to that unfortunate fellow,
gifted with keener wits, a more subtile
wariness.  The stand S'phiry Ann had taken
against him roused bitter resentment in his soul,
but the fact that he loved her so strongly made
him loath to leave her.  A happy dream of one
day having her in his home, pervading it with
the sweetness of her presence, had been his
close and faithful companion for years,
comforting his lonely winter nights when the wind
tore wildly over the mountains, and the rain
beat upon his cabin roof, or giving additional
glory to languorous summer noons, when the
cloud-shadows seemed to lie motionless on the
distant heights, and the sluggish river fed
moisture to the heated valley.

What right had she to spoil this dream
before it had become a reality?  He could not
trust himself to argue the matter with her then,
but abruptly rose to his feet.

"We'll not say any more this mornin', though
I do think a-settin' up Al Hendries's wife ag'in
me is an onjestice.  Me an' some o' the boys
air comin' down ter ole man Whitaker's this
evenin,' an' bein' agreeable I might step down
to see you ag'in."

"Jest as ye please," she quietly replied; then
with a tinge of color added, "Ef you'll go back
ter the clearin' I'll do jest what I promised,
Gabe."

But without saying whether he would or
would not, Gabe shouldered his gun and went
away.

S'phiry Ann had been very calm and decided
throughout the interview, but the moment
her lover had disappeared she sank trembling
on the bench, her face hidden in her hands.

"Ef it hadn't 'a' be'n for thinkin' o' Al Hendries's
wife I never could 'a' stood up ag'in him,"
she sighed faintly.

A squirrel springing nimbly from a laurel to
a slender chesnut-tree paused on a swaying
branch to look at her, and a bird fluttered
softly in the sweet-gum above her.  The sun
slipped under a cloud, and when she rose to go
about her work, the spring day had grown gray
and dull.  It sent a shiver through her, as she
stared dejectedly at the overshadowed valley.
She had little time, though, for idle indulgence—she
must be at her washing; and presently
when the clouds had drifted away, and the
sunshine steeped the earth in its warmth again,
her spirits rose, a song burst from her lips—an
ancient hymn, old almost as the everlasting
mountains around her.

The day waxed to full noon, then waned,
and S'phiry Ann spread the clothes on the
garden-fence and the grass to dry.  There were
other duties awaiting her.  The geese must
be driven up, the cows milked, and water
brought from the spring for evening use.  Then
she would put on her clean cotton gown, and
smooth the tangles out of her hair, before Gabe
came in.  It was all accomplished as she had
planned, and at dusk she sat on the rear step
of the entry taking a few minutes of well-earned
rest.  The light streamed out from the
kitchen, falling across the clean, bare yard and
sending shifting gleams up among the young
leaves of the trees.  On the kitchen step sat
Eph, an orphan boy of twelve or thirteen the
Standneges had adopted, whittling a hickory
stick for a whistle, and at his side crouched a
lean, ugly hound.  S'phiry could see her father
tilted back in a chair against the loom, talking
to Jim Wise, a valley farmer who had come up
to salt his cattle on the mountains, while her
mother and sister passed back and forth,
preparing supper.  The voices of the men were
raised, and presently she heard Wise say:

"The raiders air out ter-night, so I hearn
comin' up the mountain.  They air expectin' ter
ketch up with things this time, bein' as somebody
has been a-tellin',—it 'pears so, anyway."

S'phiry Ann pressed her hands together with
a little gasp.

"The boys air got they years open," said
Mr. Standnege with a slow smile, his half-shut
eyes twinkling.

"But this is er onexpected move, an' they
mayn't be a-lookin' fer it," persisted the other
man.

"They air always a-ready an' a-lookin'.
They ain't ter be tuk nappin'."

But the girl, listening with breathless attention,
shivered, not sharing her father's easy
confidence.  She remembered that Gabe Plummer
had said they were coming down to old man
Whitaker's, and she knew that they were off
guard.  They would be caught, she thought,
with a cold sensation around her heart; Gabe
would be put in jail, and locked up, probably
for months, and then come back with all the
youth and strength gone from him.  Even as
these thoughts were passing through her mind,
a sound fell on her ears, faint, far away, and
yet to her, alert, keenly alive to the approach
of danger, terribly significant.  It was the
steady tramp of iron-shod hoofs upon the road,
and it approached from the valley.  She sat
motionless, but with fierce-beating heart,
listening and feeling sure it was the enemy drawing
near.

The revenue men had always looked upon
the Standneges as peaceful, law-abiding
citizens, and though no information had ever been
obtained from them, the officers sometimes
stopped with them, lounged in the entry, or
sat at their board, partakers of their humble
fare.  Probably they intended stopping for
supper.  The girl devoutly hoped they would.
The steady tramp grew louder, the hound
pricked up his long ears, sniffed the air, then
dashed around the house with a deep, hostile
yelp.  The next moment a party of horsemen
halted before the gate.  Her fears were realized.

The dog barked noisily, the men chaffed
each other in a hilarious way, while the horses
stamped and breathed loudly, and the quiet
place seemed all at once vivified with fresh life.
Standnege went out to the gate followed by
his guest; Mrs. Standnege and Polly came to
the door and peered out, and Eph hurriedly
closed his knife and thrust the whistle into his
pocket preparatory to following his elders.
The officers would not dismount, though
hospitably pressed to do so.

"'Light, 'light, an' come in; the wimmen
folks air jest a-gettin' supper," said Standnege
cordially.

"Business is too urgent.  We are bound to
capture our men to-night.  Why, the whole
gang are coming down out of their lair to old
man Whitaker's to-night, so we have been
informed, and we must be on hand to welcome
them."

Eph crossed the yard, but when he would
have stepped up to take a short cut through the
entry, his hand was caught in another hand so
cold it sent a shiver of terror over him.

"My—why, S'phiry Ann!" he sharply exclaimed.

"Hush!" she whispered, drawing him out
of the light.  "Will you go with me ter ole
man Whitaker's, Eph?"

"This time o' night?"

"Yes, now."

"It's more'n a mile."

"We'll take the nigh cut through the woods."

"Dark as all git-out."

"I'm not afeerd; I'll go erlone then," she
said with contempt.

"What air you up ter?—Good Lord!
S'phiry Ann, do you think that could be done
an' they a-ridin'?" suddenly understanding her
purpose.

"Nothin' like tryin'," she replied, and glided
like a shadow around the corner of the house.

The boy stared for a moment after her.

"Well, *I* never!" he muttered, and followed on.

They ran through the orchard, an ill-kept,
weedy place full of stunted apple-trees, across
a freshly plowed field to the dense, black
woods beyond.  It was a clear night, the sky
thickly set with stars, and low in the west a
pale new moon hanging between two towering
sentinel peaks, but the light could not
penetrate to the narrow pathway S'phiry Ann had
selected as the nearest route to Whitaker's.
The awful solitude, the intense darkness, did
not daunt her.  She knew the way, her footing
was sure, and she ran swiftly as a deer before
the hunters, animated by one desire—to get to
Whitaker's before the officers.  It was a
desperate chance.  If her father detained them a
few minutes longer—but if they hastened on—she
caught her breath and quickened her own
steps.  Eph stumbled pantingly along behind
her, divided between admiration at her fleetness
and anger that he had been called on to
take part in such a mad race.

In speaking of it afterward, he said:

"I never seed a creetur git over more ground
in ez short a time sence that hound o' Mis'
Beaseley's got pizened.  It's a dispensin' er
providence her neck wusn't broke, a-rushin'
through them gullies an' up them banks, an'
it so dark you mought 'a' fell plum' inter the
bottomless pit an' not 'a' knowed it."

But S'phiry Ann had no consideration to
spare to personal danger, as she broke through
the underbrush and climbed stony, precipitous
heights.  Once an owl flew across her way, its
outspread wings almost brushing her face, and
with a terrified hoot sought a new hiding-place.
The wind swept whisperingly through
the forest, and a loosened stone rolled down
and fell with a dull, hollow sound into the black
depths of the ravine below them.  Eph wished
they had brought a torch, wished that he had
not come, then struck out in a fresh heat, as he
heard a mysterious rustling in the bushes behind him.

At last they emerged from the woods opposite
Whitaker's, and S'phiry Ann leaned for a
moment against the fence, panting, breathless,
but exultant.  She had won the race.

The house was only one forlorn old room,
built of rough hewn logs, with a rickety shed
in the rear.  A small garden spot and the
meager space inclosed with the house comprised
all the open ground.  Mountains rose darkly
above it, and, below, the mountain road
wound and twisted in its tortuous course, to
the fair, open valley.  At the back of the
dwelling the ridge shelved abruptly off into a
deep ravine, dark the brightest noonday—an
abyss of blackness at night.

From the low, wide, front door ruddy light
streamed generously, defying the brooding
night, playing fantastic tricks with the thickly
growing bushes on the roadside.  The girl had
a good view of the interior, the men lounging
around the fire, the vivid flame of pine-knots
bringing out the lines in their tanned, weather-beaten
faces, flashing into their lowering eyes,
and searching out with cruel distinctness all
the rough shabbiness of their coarse homespun
and jeans.

There were the Whitaker boys, hardy, middle-aged
men; Jeff Ward, a little shriveled fellow
with long, tangled, gray beard and sharp,
watchful eyes; Bill Fletcher, who had bravely
survived the trials which had proved the death
of his comrade, poor Al Hendries; Jeems
Allen, a smooth-faced boy, and Gabe Plummer.
He sat somewhat aloof from the others, staring
gloomily into the fire, instead of giving
attention to the lively story Jeff Ward was telling.
At one end of the great hearth, laid of rough
unhewn rocks, sat old man Whitaker, at the
other, his wife—a gray and withered couple;
he tremulous with age, she deaf as a stone.

Nobody seemed to be on the lookout for
enemies.  The wide-flung door, the brilliant
light, the careless group, gave an impression
of security.

What had become of the revenue officers?
No sound of hoofs struck upon the hard road,
or murmur of voices betrayed hostile approach.
Eph turned and peered down the road, then
clutched excitedly at his companion's arm.

"Good Lord, S'phiry Ann! they're right
down there a-hitchin' they horses an' a-gittin'
ready ter creep up.  I'm er-goin' ter leave here."

S'phiry Ann sprang across the fence, and the
next moment stood in the door.

"The raiders! the raiders air a-comin'!" she
cried, not loudly, but with startling
distinctness; her torn dress, wild, loose hair, and
brilliant, excited eyes, giving her a strangely
unfamiliar aspect.  The warning cry thrilled
through the room and brought every man to
his feet in an instant.

"Whar? which way?" exclaimed young
Jeems Allen, staring first up among the
smoke-blackened rafters, then at the solid log wall.

"'Tain't the time fer axin' questions, but fer
runnin', boys," said Jeff Ward, making a dash
toward the back door, closely followed by his
comrades.  Gabe Plummer had made a step
toward S'phiry Ann, but she vanished as she
appeared, and he escaped with his friends into
the fastnesses of the woods.  There was a
shout from the raiders, creeping stealthily
around the house, a disordered pursuit, and
over the cabin the stillness following a sudden
whirlwind seemed to fall.

S'phiry Ann crept cautiously out from the
chimney-corner, slipped over the fence, and
knelt down in the edge of the bushes, to watch
and wait.  The officers soon returned with
torn clothes, scratched hands and faces, but
without a prisoner.  They were swearing in no
measured terms at being baffled of their prey.

Old man Whitaker and his wife had quietly
remained in the house, apparently not greatly
moved from their usual placidity.  Once the
old woman dropped the ball of coarse yarn she
was winding, and rose to her feet, but the old
man motioned her down again.  They were
questioned by the officers, but what reliable
information could be expected from an imbecile
old man and a deaf old woman?  The girl
could overlook the whole scene from a crack in
the fence—the officers stamping about the
room, the scattered chairs, the old people with
their withered yellow faces, dim eyes, and bent,
shrunken forms, and the dancing flames leaping
up the wide sooty chimney.  Satisfied that the
distillers were safe, she softly rose and started
across the road.  One of the men caught a
glimpse of her, the merest shadowy outline,
and instantly shouted:

"There goes one of 'em now!"

She heard him—heard the rush of feet over
the threshold and the bare yard, and without
a backward glance, fled like a wild thing
through the woods, home.

One afternoon, a week later, S'phiry Ann
drew the wheel out into the middle of the
kitchen floor, tightened the band, pulled a strip
of yellow corn-husk from a chink in the logs
to wrap the spindle, and set herself to finish
spinning the "fillin'" for the piece of cloth in
the loom.  Her mother and sister were out in
the garden sowing seeds, Eph was cutting
bushes in the new ground, and she could hear
the loud, resonant "geehaw" with which her
father guided the ox drawing his plow.  It
was a serenely still day—the heat of
mid-summer in its glowing sunshine, with only a
fleck of cloud here and there along the horizon,
and mountains wrapped in a fine blue haze.

It had been a trying week to S'phiry Ann,
but she had no time to mope and brood over
her anxieties, no inclination to confide them to
her family.  She had not shirked daily duties,
but went about them silently and without
enthusiasm.  The revenue officers, disgusted,
angered at their disappointment, lingered on
the mountains several days, seeking something
to lay violent hands on.  One still they found
and destroyed, but if the earth had opened and
swallowed them, their prey could not have
disappeared more completely.  The law is strong,
but it loses its power when carried into the
strongholds of the mountains, majestic, clothed
in repose, yielding up their secrets only to
those bred and born upon them.

S'phiry Ann lifted her eyes to the lofty
heights, yearning to know if her lover and his
friends had found safe refuge, trembling with
terror every time the dog barked or an ox-cart
creaked slowly along the road.  When the
family were made acquainted with her part in
that Monday night raid, there were various
exclamatory remarks at the inconsistency of
her behavior.  Mrs. Standnege dropped her
pipe, and stared at her in great amazement.

"Well, ef you don't beat all!  Last Sunday
a-slightin' Gabe Plummer at meetin', an' now
mighty nigh a-breakin' yer neck ter git him
outen the way o' the raiders."

"Gabe wasn't the only one thar," said the
girl in a low tone.

"But it stands ter reason you wouldn't 'a'
done it, ef he hadn't 'a' be'n thar.  Yer pap
may hev ter look out fer a new farm-hand arter
all," with a touch of facetious humor, but
watching the slow reddening of the girl's throat and
face.  Standnege came to her aid—

"Let her be, ma, an' work it out in her own
mind.  Thar ain't no 'countin' fer the doin's o'
wimmun folks, no how.  They air mighty
oncertain creeturs."

"Why, pap!" exclaimed his eldest daughter,
a mixture of indignation and reproach in her
tone.

"Now, I ain't a-meanin' ter throw off on 'em,
an' I don't say as they ain't all steddy enough
when they settle down, but a gal in love is the
oncertainest creetur that ever lived.  Now
S'phiry Ann ain't a-lackin' in common sense
an' grit, if she does belong to me," he continued,
with calm impartiality; "an' ef she wants ter
marry Gabe Plummer 'fore craps air laid by,
she kin do it."

But it was Monday again, and S'phiry felt
that her fortune was still an unsettled thing.

"Ef it hadn't 'a' be'n for thinkin' o' Al
Hendries's wife," she said to herself again and again,
and the old spinning-wheel flew swiftly
beneath strong, young fingers, and the yellow
corn-husk on the spindle filled slowly with
smooth, even thread.  She could look as
downcast and troubled as her heart prompted, for
no curious eyes were resting on her.  Was it
true?  A shadow suddenly darkened the doorway.

"Howd'y'do, S'phiry Ann?"

The half-twisted thread fell from her fingers,
writhed and rolled along the floor, fair sport
for the kitten lazily coiled on the hearth, while
she turned toward the secretly wished-for, but
unexpected, visitor.  She trembled, and the
color in her face flushed and paled.

"Gabe!"  Then quickly, and with a swift
searching glance toward the road, "is it safe
for you ter be here?"

"Yes, they air gone—an' ter the devil, I
hope."  He leaned against the wall, jaded,
forlorn-looking, the week of hiding out not
improving either temper or appearance.

"Take a cheer, an' set down, Gabe," she
said, a vibration of tenderest pity in her
voice.

"I ain't a-keerin' tu rest jest yit.  That was
a good turn you done us t'other night.  No
tellin' where we would be now ef it hadn't 'a'
be'n fer that.  I don't know how to thank you
fer it, S'phiry Ann," he said, with strong
emotion in his voice.

"Don't, Gabe!" she stammered, stooping to
snatch the tangled thread from the paws of the
kitten.

"Would you 'a' done it fer me?"

"'Tain't fair tu be axin' sech questions," she
said defensively.

"'Cordin' tu promise you air tu marry me."

"I saud ut ef you 'ud go back tu the clearin'."

"Yes, an' that's jest what I'm a-goin' tu do.
I've had a week o' thinkin', an' now I'm willin'
tu 'low you kin hev your way.  Ain't I b'en
tu put my head outen the holler?" he
continued in angry disgust; "afeerd tu tech a
leaf fer the noise it made? afeerd tu draw
my breath? an' I tell ye, I ain't a-hankerin' arter
any more sech days, an' I told the boys so, an'
I'm a-goin' back tu the clearin' ef every crap
fails."

S'phiry Ann stood by the wheel, her face
turned from him, silent, motionless.  He
waited a moment, then strode across the floor,
and laid his hand on her shoulder.

"We mus' settle it now, S'phiry, I ain't
a-blamin' you now, though I don't say as I
didn't, back yander a week ergo, fer standin'
tu principle."

"Ef it hadn't 'a' be'n fer thinkin' o' Al
Hendries's wife," she said gently.

"I've be'n a-lovin' you er long time, an' it's
tu settle what we air a-goin' tu do."

"The clearin' settles it, Gabe," she
murmured, and turned her head slowly until her
eyes, softly radiant, met his eager, ardent
ones.

   AN "ONFORTUNIT CREETUR."

.. vspace:: 2

Mrs. Upchurch sat in the entry of her house
knitting, while down on the step—a rough
block of Georgia granite—Mr. Upchurch sat
resting and smoking an after-dinner pipe.  It
was on a summer afternoon, and the hot glare
of the sun made a shade gratefully welcome.
The house had only the space of an ordinary
yard between it and the public country road,
but it was on a breezy hill and commanded a
fine view of the surrounding country.

Far away, above the green, wooded hills and
valleys, rose the North Georgia Mountains,
veiled in misty blue.  Those mountains were
the boundary line of Mrs. Upchurch's world.
She had never gone to them; she never dreamed
of going beyond them.  Still, they were old
friends, immovable, unchangeable, upon which
she could look when perplexed, sorrowful, or
glad.  She worked slowly, and often glanced
away toward those distant peaks, a very grave
meditative light in her eyes.

She was a woman above medium height, and
rather dignified in appearance and manner, with
a kind, homely face, yellowed and hardened
by sun and wind, and with honest, steadfast
eyes.  She had on a stout, plain cotton dress,
and an old brown veil was drawn around her
head and tied under her chin.  Summer and
winter she wore it, to ward off that greatest
enemy of her peace—neuralgia.

"He always was an onfortunit creetur," she
said abruptly, and with a sigh.

"Who now, Peggy?" inquired Mr. Upchurch
in some surprise.

"Why, Ab," and laying her knitting down
on her knee, she smoothed it out thoughtfully.

"That brother o' your'n?"

"Yes; I said he always was an onfortunit
creetur."

"Yes, onfortunitly lazy," her husband dryly
observed.

"He all but died wi' the measles when he
was a sucklin' baby not more'n three months
old, an' then 'long come the whoopin'-cough on
the heels er that, an' liked to 'a' tuk him off.
Then you remember ther time he was snake-bit
on his big toe, an' how the pizen flew all
over him like lightnin', an' he would er died ef
we hadn't er happened ter have some dram in
the house.  Then he tuk cramp once in Punkin
Vine Creek, an' would er drownded right on
the spot ef Providence hadn't er sent the
singin'-school teacher along fer ter fish him out."

The half-forgotten incidents of childhood
and youth crowded fresh upon her memory.
She leaned forward, resting her elbows on her
knees—a favorite attitude with many country
women when they are smoking their pipes,
dipping snuff, or are lost in deep thought—and
thrust a knitting-needle through her hair.  But
her reminiscences did not impress her husband
very deeply.  He eyed her kindly, and with a
slight touch of pity.

"You hain't seen him sence the war, Peggy.
What's got inter you that yer mind keeps er
runnin' onter him ter-day?"

"I'm shore I don't know, Sam, but it's er
fact.  I ain't thought as much erbout him these
twenty years an' more as I have ter-day.  Mebby
Ab's a-comin'."

"Mebby he is, but 'tain't likely at this late
day, an' I wouldn't be a-botherin' erbout it,
Peggy," said the farmer, shaking the ashes out
of his pipe before placing it in his pocket.

"I ain't exactly botherin', Sam, but I dreamed
erbout him las' night, an' takin' it all
tergether it jes' pesters me er little."

Mr. Upchurch got up slowly from his resting-place,
and stepping into the west room, took
down his gun from over the door.

"B'lieve I'll go a-huntin', Peggy."

"Well," she answered, absently, still thinking
of her brother, and wondering if she would
ever see him again.

"He's that onfortunit, he might 'a' wandered
off an' er died among strangers, with not er
soul ter look arter him, or ter put him erway
decently," she murmured in a troubled undertone.
"I can't fergit the time he stood between
me an' old Miss Whitlock's dog, that run mad
when me an' him was little fellers.  He was
always sorter sickly an' quare, but I knowed
then he had grit, for there he stood as calm as
could be, an' that dog a-comin' straight fer
him, or so it 'peared like, jest er-foamin' at the
mouth.  I thought shore Ab 'ud be bit plum'
through, but the critter passed by without
techin' him.  Them days is all over, but I
ain't fergot that, I orter love him, poor
feller!"  And she looked away to those blue
mountains with eyes grown dim with sudden
tears.

It was Saturday afternoon, and therefore a
holiday among the farmers.  A man must be
hard pushed indeed who will not "knock off"
Saturday afternoon.

The Upchurch family were thrifty, industrious
people, took care of their not too fertile
farm, lived honest lives, and kept peace with
their neighbors.

"Upchurch is er smart man, ef I do say it,"
his wife would sometimes proudly remark.
"When me an' him married we 'lowed we'd
help one ernuther, an' mebby we'd git helped;
an' so we did, fer Providence always helps them
that helps themselves."

Peggy Upchurch was a good woman, and
noted among her neighbors and friends for her
readiness to visit the sick and the sorrowful.
She was a useful woman in her narrow sphere,
a strict member of Ebenezer Baptist Church,
and while she did not consider it right "fer
wimmin to speak out in meetin'," she did a good
deal of missionary work quietly.

She rose and glanced around to see if
everything had been put in proper order, then sat
down again, with her snuff-box and her
knitting on her lap.

The house was a double log-house—that is,
two large rooms with a wide, open entry
between, and a loft above.  In the furnishing of
those rooms, the chief consideration seemed to
have been beds—high feather beds, with blue
and white checked foot-curtains concealing the
unpainted pine posts of the bedsteads, and
elaborately fringed "double-wove" counterpanes
spread over them.  Those beds were the
pride of Mrs. Upchurch's heart.

"I raised them feathers myself, an' I know
they er fresh ernough fer the President ter
sleep on."

Doors stood wide open, letting in sunshine
and sweet flowers' scents, and George
Washington looked down from his rusty frame with
a gracious unbending of his dignity.

A few scrubby oaks shaded the clean-swept
yard, and a honeysuckle vine had been trained
to climb and spread itself over the rough logs
of the house.  A fine rose-bush bloomed beside
the gate, and there were beds of larkspur,
pinks, and sweet-williams in the sunnier spots.

It was a home the counterpart of which may
be found in almost any portion of Georgia,
bare and rather lonely looking, but clean and
healthy, and to the householders acceptable as
a kingly palace.  It appeared a very haven of
rest and peace to the tired, dusty tramp toiling
up the wide, hot road.  His eyes wandered
from object to object as though the place was
not unfamiliar to him, and a slight quiver of
emotion crossed his features when that roving
glance fell on Mrs. Upchurch.  He carried a
small bundle hanging from the end of a knotted
hickory stick over his right shoulder, and he
walked in a halting, uneven way.  He turned
from the road and stopped at the gate.

"Good-evenin', ma'am."

"Good-evenin', sir," said Mrs. Upchurch,
looking at him with some curiosity.

He opened the gate.

"May I come in an' git er drink er water?
Walkin' is pow'ful hot work."

"Ter be shore; jes' walk right in an' take er
seat an' rest yerself; you look plum' fagged out,"
said the hospitable woman, rising and placing
a chair out in the entry for him.

He walked across the yard in a footsore and
weary way, and dropped feebly down on the
edge of the floor, laying his stick and meager
bundle beside him.  He took off his ragged old
hat, and wiped his face on a faded cotton
handkerchief.  He was a sorry-looking case,
shabbily dressed, thin, and stooping, and without
the color of blood about his sallow face and
hardened hands.  His eyes were hollow, and
he coughed once or twice a dry hacking cough.
So utterly forlorn and friendless did he appear,
that deep pity stirred Mrs. Upchurch's heart.
He stared hard at her, his face working in an
agitated manner.  She brought him a gourd of
water, and taking it in his trembling hands, he
drank slowly from it.

"That's good," he muttered softly.

"Yes, we've got the best well in this country.
But won't you take this cheer an' rest?  It's
better'n the floor," she said compassionately.

"No'm.  Is this—where—Sam—Upchurch—lives—that
married Peggy Dyer?" he slowly
inquired.

"Why, yes; Upchurch bought this place
before me an' him was married, an' we've been
er-livin' here ever sence," she said, surprised,
and striving to recognize him.  He had called
her name with the ease and familiarity of one
well acquainted with it, but not a friend of her
youth could she recall who would bear the
slightest resemblance to this poor wanderer.
Singularly enough, at that moment she had
forgotten the brother Ab who had been
haunting her memory all day.  "You're not er
stranger in this settlement, air you?"

"Yes, it 'pears like I am now.  You don't
seem to know me, Peggy?" he said with a sort
of tremble in his voice, his haggard eyes raised
to her pleasant, homely face.

She fell to trembling then herself, and her
sunburnt face grew pale, for a sudden thought
flashed into her mind—a bare possibility,
that overcame her.  She sat down in her
chair, with a searching, eager look at the
shabby, stooping figure, and pallid, sickly face.

"I orter know that voice; it 'pears like—"
she faltered unsteadily.

"Have you forgot yer brother Ab, Peggy?"

   :alt: "HAVE YOU FERGOT YER BROTHER AB, PEGGY?"

   "HAVE YOU FERGOT YER BROTHER AB, PEGGY?"

"Lor', Ab! that ain't possible!  it's too good
ter be true!" she cried, and then burst into
joyful tears.

"Yes, it's me," he said quietly, and wiped
his own eyes.

There were no open demonstrations of love.
They did not even shake hands.

"Air you glad ter see me, Peggy?" he
asked in a sort of sad wonder, but no longer
doubtful of his welcome.

"Glad!  O Ab, ain't I been a-wantin' ter see
you fer nigh on ter twenty years?" she cried,
in a voice that might have laid the most
subtile doubts at rest.  "Come in, brother, and
take a cheer, do," wiping her eyes on her
knitting, and looking at him tenderly.

"I'm not a-hurtin' here, Peggy.  I'm tired
enough to rest ennywheres.  It's been er hard
pull ter git here."

"Praise the Lord that you did git here!" she
ejaculated fervently.

She took his hat and stick and bundle and
put them away, she brought him more water,
and when he declined any further service she
drew her chair near him, and sat down.

"You look well an' hearty, Peggy."

"Yes, I ain't got nothin' ter complain
erbout; but you—you're dreadful peaked, Ab,"
she faltered, her heart yearning over him.

He drew his handkerchief across his face again,
and coughed that dull, hacking little cough.

"I've been a'mos' dead with my liver.
Low-country life didn't agree with me, an' I've
been onfortunit, Peggy."

"You always was onfortunit, Ab.  Me an'
Upchurch have jes' been a-talkin' of the many
times you come nigh ter losin' yer life when er
boy, let erlone the war an' sence the war.
Upchurch is gone a-huntin' now, an' Tempy an'
the boys, they er gone over the creek ter town;
but as I started ter say, it's cur'us how some
folks hev ter live, sorter holdin' on ter life
ennyhow.  It's er slippery thing at the best,
somethin' like er eel that'll slip through yer
fingers jest when you're shore you've got it"
(ending with a sigh).

"I've had my sheer er bad luck now, shorely,"
said Dyer wearily.

"Then you must be a-lookin' out for the
good," said his sister more cheerfully.  The
deep dejection, the utter hopelessness of tone
and appearance troubled her—took away
something from her joy.  She grew anxious to
see him brighten up, raise his head, and speak
with animation.  She could not keep her eyes
off him.  His vagabond appearance, his evident
ill health roused all her sisterly love, her
womanly compassion.  Oh, what a hard life he
must have lived to be so changed!  He had
been a weak and ailing child, and odd,
extremely odd, in all his ways.  She, being the
eldest, had watched over him, and had learned
to know him better than any one else did, but
she never expected to see him so unkempt,
neglected, and broken down.

"Oh, brother, what've you been a-doin' with
yourself?" she said abruptly, her eyes filling
up again.

"A-roamin' up an' down the world.  Lately
I've be'n livin' down in southwest Georgia.
I married there," he replied.

"Law! you did?  Where is your wife?"

"Dead, an' so is my little gal.  She was er
peart little thing," and he turned his head
away, swallowing audibly, as though something
choked him.  "I wish you could 'a' seed
her, Peggy," he continued after a slight
pause.

"An' I wish it too, Ab.  Can't you tell me
erbout her?" she said gently, and with deep
sympathy.

"She was the smartest little creetur I ever
saw, an' knowed the mos' for her age.  She
use' ter run an' meet me when I come in, an'
the fust thing 'ud be, 'Daddy, I love you; do
you love me?'  Then she'd put her arms round
my neck an' lay her face up close ter mine.
Then when she got bigger, she was always
a-wantin' ter help me, an' I never axed for
better comp'ny than my little Sary Jane.  O
Lord! if she'd only 'a' lived.  It fairly tuk the
life outen me to see her—to see her—"

His head dropped on his breast, and again
he was silent.

"You er 'bout all the kin I've got, Peggy,"
he said at last, and there was something in the
broken way he uttered the few words that
caused her to wipe her eyes again furtively on
her knitting.

"You mus' stay with me now, Ab, an' not
go wanderin' off enny more.  You've be'n
keerless erbout your health, I know in reason."

"Mebby I have."

He met his brother-in-law rather shrinkingly
at first, but Sam Upchurch gave him such a
hearty welcome, he seemed to grow more at
ease.  About sundown the children returned
from their holiday visit to Rockymount, a
small town two miles away across Bear Creek.
There were four—three sturdy sunburnt boys
and one handsome sunburnt girl.  She was the
eldest, and Mrs. Upchurch presented her to
her uncle with motherly pride.

"This is our Tempy, Ab."

He looked at the tall, bright-eyed, rose-faced
girl with melancholy surprise.  He shook
hands with her in an awkward, hesitating way.

"Why, she's grown, Peggy."

"Yes, grown, an' talkin' er gittin' married,"
said Peggy with a laugh and a sigh.

"Law, now, ma, jes' lis'en at you!" cried
Tempy, blushing crimson and retreating to
the kitchen.

The young people eyed the new-comer
cautiously, and would have little to say to him;
but the elders used all their homely arts to
entertain him and make him comfortable.
After supper, when they had returned from the
kitchen to the entry, he grew more communicative.
The boys were off in the thickets bird-thrashing,
and Tempy sat in the best room
with Jeff Morgan, her sweetheart, who lived
in an adjoining settlement, and came on
Saturday evening, and remained until Monday
morning.  So the older people were sitting
alone in the entry, and Sam Upchurch smoked
his pipe, and Peggy dipped snuff, but Dyer
declined joining them in using tobacco.

"Had ter quit that years ergo.  I have had
ups an' downs sence the war.  One time I
went down inter the piny woods of Alabama
an' j'ined the gopher traders, but it wasn't a
payin' business, an' I quit it an' sot up ter
teachin' school.  If you can spell *baker* you
can teach school in them diggin's.  Then I tuk
it inter my head to settle down an' have er
home; but Susan she died, and the little un
had ter go too, an' I've jes' be'n knockin'
erbout ever sence."  His poor thin hands worked
nervously, and his head drooped dejectedly
again.

How sharply his empty, desolate life
contrasted with his sister's busy, useful, happy
one!  Her husband was beside her; the shouts
of her boys floated up from the pine thickets
where their torches flashed in and out like the
flame of a "Jack-o'-lantern," and occasionally
Tempy's full, hearty laugh rang out.  The sister
thought of it with a sigh, but feeling humbly
grateful for her own good fortune.  Upchurch,
too, vaguely felt the contrast, for he said:
"Well, you've got er home here now if you
er mind ter take it.  Peggy'll be doctorin' you
up in no time."

He shook his head with a faint, dry smile.

A screech-owl flew into the yard near the
house and began a doleful "shir-r-r-r."  The
men did not seem to notice it, but Mrs. Upchurch
moved uneasily, for neither religion
nor common sense could rid her of the
superstitious feeling that it meant bad luck.  That
night her short, simple, but earnest prayers
included the poor wanderer, and also an
entreaty that no bad luck might come to any of
them.

On Sunday morning the wagon was brought
around, and all the family came out in their
"go-ter-meetin'" clothes.

Ab declined accompanying them, although
he had partially recovered from the fatigue of
the day before, and he obstinately refused to
allow one of the family to remain at home with
him, to his sister's distress.  She would gladly
have remained, for there were still many
things she wished to talk over with him, but
he would not hear to it.

"I make no pretensions, Peggy, but neither
am I goin' ter keep them erway that does," he
said more decidedly than she had yet heard
him speak.

He was sitting on the fence whittling a stick,
and many were the curious glances directed
toward the shabby, stooping figure, as the
country people passed on their way to Ebenezer.

It was soon known throughout the settlement
that Ab Dyer, Peggy Upchurch's brother
had come, and the women discovered they
owed Peggy a visit, and the men dropped in
to see Upchurch, or to borrow some farming
tool.  Ab did not impress the visitors very
favorably.  Some regarded him suspiciously,
others with more or less contempt.

"He's shore to be crazy," said old Miss
Davis confidentially to Sally Gancey.

"You reckon?" in a shocked tone.

"Yes, an' er tramp, too.  Won't you take er
dip?" producing the little black snuff-box her
grandfather had bequeathed to her.

"B'lieve I will.  Po' Mis' Upchurch! how
she mus' feel!"

"Law, it ain't no new thing.  I knowed Ab
Dyer when he wasn't much bigger'n er woodpeck,
an' he never was right bright.  He ain't
'walked fur with Solomon,' I kin tell you,"
rolling her eyes knowingly.

So the bit of gossip went from house to
house, and hints of it reached the Upchurches;
but if the poor wanderer ever heard of it, he
made no sign.  Yet it cut Peggy Upchurch to
the heart, and she strove, by additional
tenderness and consideration, to make up to him for
all he had lost in not gaining the good will of
the neighbors.

"I've always noticed that them that's talked
erbout is apt ter be better than them that does
the talkin'," she said privately to Upchurch.

But once she ventured to gently remonstrate
with Ab about the palpable lack of pride in his
personal appearance.

"'Tain't no use, Peggy.  I wanted ter be somethin'
an' I tried, but ever'thing went ag'in' me."

"You mus'n't be mad erbout that, Ab.  It
was the Almighty's doin's, though I ain't one
er them that lays ever'thing ter Providence.
Mebby you didn't start right."

"Mebby I didn't," he replied, spiritlessly,
and with a fit of coughing.  He sat on the
door-step in the sunshine, his shoulders bent
over, his chin almost touching his knees, as
much of a vagabond as the day on which he
walked up the road, seeking the last of his kith
and kin.

"It pesters me to see you so down in the
mouth.  I'm all the time a-wantin' ter see you
pearten up.  Don't that fat light'ood-splinter
tea help yer cough?"

"No; but don't you be a-botherin' erbout
me, Peggy.  'Tain't no use."

"Ah, that sayin' o' yourn, ''Tain't no use,'
has done a sight er harm in this world.  Too
many folks says it fer their own good," said
Mrs. Upchurch solemnly.

"That may be so, but I ain't been no use ter
myself nor nobody else."

"Well, I say you have.  Don't forgit yer
young days an' the time you run between me
an' old Miss Whitlock's mad dog.  I remember
it, an' I'll keep on rememberin' it till I die."

"Lor'! that wasn't nothin'," he said, moving
uneasily, a sort of flush passing over his face.

"Yet if you hadn't 'a' done it, I might not
'a' been here now," impressively, and with the
feeling that she must ever hold him lovingly
and gratefully in her heart, no matter how
idle and purposeless his life might be—and
one might better have been dead than lazy in
that community.

"Mebby if the little un had 'a' lived—"
he muttered, but leaving the sentence unfinished,
he hastily rose and walked away toward
the lot.

He grew rather fond of Tempy, after a
cautious, undemonstrative fashion.  His eyes
would follow her in an absorbed, wistful way,
for in her he saw, as it were, a pale vision of
his own child grown to womanhood—a pale
vision, for no girl could compare with what the
reality would have been in his eyes.

Tempy's wedding-day approached, and he
astonished her with the gift of ten
dollars—all he had.

"Ter help buy yer fixin's," he said, and
carefully restored the empty leather purse to
his pocket.

The days came and went, and the farmers
worked from daylight till dark, but Ab Dyer
idled about the house or wandered aimlessly
through the woods with a gun.  Sometimes
he would bring home game, but oftener he
would come empty-handed.

"What ails him, Peggy?" Sam Upchurch
inquired one evening, after Dyer had gone off
to bed.  "There ain't nothin' to be got outen
him."

"He's give up—that's what ails him, an' it's
the worst thing a body could do fer themselves.
Ab always was easy to git down in
the mouth, an' it 'pears like he ain't a-goin' to
git over the loss o' his fambly.  Poor
fellow! he always was an onfortunit creetur,"
wiping her eyes on her nightcap and sighing
deeply.

The summer drew near its end, and one
cloudy morning, late in August, Sam
Upchurch pulled out the buggy, harnessed his
best horse to it, and invited Ab to go with him
over to Rockymount, to buy some things for
Tempy's wedding.  It had rained torrents the
night before, and Bear Creek rushed along
turbulent, muddy, and nearly up to the
bridge.

"But we'll be all right, if it don't set in to
rainin' ag'in," said Upchurch, taking a
sweeping glance at the clouds rolling so darkly
above them.

"An' ef it does?" Ab dryly inquired.

"Well, I reckon we will, ennyhow; the
bridge is new," Sam easily and carelessly
replied.

It did rain again, heavy, flooding rains, and
they were detained in town until quite late.
Indeed, they did not realize how swiftly the
day passed, until night was upon them.

"Better lie over in town to-night.  Bear
Creek ain't er pleasant sight jes' now," said an
acquaintance, who also lived beyond the
creek.  But Sam Upchurch shook his head.

"No, Peggy'll be a-lookin' fer us, an' the
bridge is strong.  There ain't no danger, ef
the water does run over it."

"You don't know that.  My old woman'll
be a-lookin' fer me, too, but I ain't a-goin'
ter risk my life jes' fer that," muttered
the other countryman, shrugging his shoulders.

It was dark when the belated travelers
reached the creek—not the gray darkness of
twilight, but the pitchy blackness of a clouded,
stormy night.  They could hear the rush and
roar of the stream, and the horse trembled
and shrank back from it in fear, but, urged on
by his master's voice, he ventured in.  For
many a day Sam Upchurch reproached himself
for that rash and foolhardy act, but he
had such faith in the strength of the bridge,
that he did not think of danger until with a
desperate plunge they were floundering in the
creek.

"Good God! the bridge is gone!" he
groaned, and the next moment felt the buggy
swept away from him by the strong current.

"Ab!" he shouted loudly.

"Here I am.  Can you swim, Sam?"

"Not much here," he cried hoarsely, realizing
that only a bare chance of life remained.
A vision of his home rose up before him, and
of his wife and children; life never seemed so
precious and desirable a thing as when death
stared him in the face.  He groaned aloud;
then he heard Ab's voice close beside him—

"Ketch onter this limb."

It was a willow bough clipping into the
water, a slender, flexible thing, not strong
enough to bear the weight of both men; but
Upchurch did not know that when he clutched
so desperately at the frail chance of salvation.

Ab loosened his grasp.

"What's the matter?" cried his brother-in-law
in quick alarm, for the poor fellow brushed
against him as the strong, swift current
carried him away.

"Nothin'!  Git home ter Peggy an' the
chillun if you can.  I'm goin'"—but there his
voice died away, was swallowed up in the
confusion of noises around them.  Upchurch
shouted himself hoarse, but no reply came
back to him, and chilled and stiffened he drew
himself up out of the water, realizing at last
that Ab had given up to him the one chance
of life that lay between them.

They laid him down within the shadow
of Ebenezer Church, along with the other
quiet sleepers who rested there, and no one
ever again breathed aught against the luckless
vagabond; while in one household his
memory was gratefully and tenderly cherished.
Never did a stormy night come, but they
would draw up around the flaming pine-knot
fire thinking of him, and Mrs. Upchurch would
take one of Tempy's children on her knee, to
shield her tearful eyes from observation.

Then again she would sit in the entry
on calm, clear summer days, with her knitting
and her snuff, just as she sat that day he came
up the road, footsore, and weary with his
tramp, and, recalling all the trials and failures
of his life, she would far away toward
those misty blue mountains, softly murmuring:

"Poor Ab!  He always was an onfortunit creetur."

   A DIALECT STORY OF GEORGIA LIFE.

.. vspace:: 2

Mr. Jesse Crow sat on the front fence with
his feet comfortably resting on the lower rail,
whittling a stick.  Crops had been "laid by,"
and he felt that he could afford to sit on the
fence and engage in the pleasing recreation of
whittling.  But it was not, on this particular
occasion, enjoyed as heartily as usual.  It
seemed to be a mere mechanical occupation to
aid him in solving a knotty problem.  He was
a small, wiry, mild-eyed man, with a deeply
tanned complexion and a good-humored
expression.  He was a prosperous farmer, and
highly respected in the settlement, where he
had a good reputation for fair, honest dealing
and clear judgment, though often permitting
his love of mercy to overrule the rigid laws of
justice.

"It ain't no use in bein' hard on enny
creetur," he would say mildly.  "We ain't all
been tried erlike, an' thar mought be
extinguishin' sarcums-tances ter jedge by if we could
see 'em."

But this morning his brows were drawn
together in a perplexed frown, and he stared at
the slowly sharpening splinter with abstracted
eyes.  The steady, even fall of hoofs upon the
hard, dry road roused him from his reflections,
and glancing up he saw Jim Edwards,
his neighbor and crony, approaching on his
old gray mare.  Mr. Jesse Crow hailed him
with hearty delight.

"Won't you 'light an' come in?" he asked
hospitably.

"No, reckon not this mornin'.  Nancy's in
er pow'ful hurry fer some truck, but I don't
know as I min' a-jinin' you thar a little while."

He dismounted, threw the bridle over a low
projecting limb of the great chestnut-tree
standing near the gate, and in a few minutes
sat on the fence by the side of his friend.

"You have heard erbout Tom Fannin a-takin'
that money from Bill Sanders, down
whar they air a-workin' on the new railroad?"
he said, fumbling for his knife from mere
force of habit, and settling himself for a little
gossip.

"Yes," said Mr. Crow, seriously, "an' I
don't min' sayin' that I never was more tuk
down."

"Well, I thought better o' Tom than that
myself, but you know what the scripturs say
'bout Satan allus a-havin' work fer idle hands
ter do, an' it's purty well known Tom Fannin's
as lazy as his hide kin hold."

"Yes, that's so," assented his companion.

Edwards stole a glance at him, shifted the
tobacco around in his mouth, and then—

"How does Bet take it?" he rather diffidently inquired.

"That's what's pesterin' me erbout the
matter, Ed'ards," exclaimed Mr. Crow, dropping
the last sliver from his whittling, and turning
toward his companion.  "Bet lows he didn't
do it; she knows in reason he didn't, an' ter
that point she sticks."

"But, man alive, the money was found in his
pocket!  It was this way, an' I hearn it from
Bill hisself.  Him an' Tom has been a-roomin'
together since Tom tuk an' started to work
down thar, an' Bill one mornin' put twenty
dollars in the top er his trunk with nobody
seein' it but Tom.  At dinner-time it wus
gone.  The men, black an' white, wus all fer
havin' their pockets searched, an' when they
come ter Tom's coat a-hangin' on er bush,
thar wus the money stacked down in the little
pocket.  Some er the boys say he turned
mighty white, an' 'lowed he didn't know 'twas
thar, an' kep' on denyin' it, but the p'int is, how
did it come thar then?"

"I've tole Bet that, time an' ag'in, but
every time she sez, 'Pa, I know he didn't
take it.'"

"How do you know?" says I.

"''Cause he sez so—' as if that kin clar up the
matter.  Thar ain't no reasonin' with wimmen
folks, Ed'ards."

"That's so, Jesse.  If you ax 'em why they
believe sech an' sech, they'll apt ter say 'jes'
'cause,' an' that's all the sense you kin git
outen 'em."

"It ain't my fault Bet's been a-keepin'
comp'ny long o' Tom Fannin—it's er puzzlin'
thing ter me how she kin like him, knowin' he
is lazy an' sorter triflin', but Bet's got er head
of her own," with a sudden touch of pride, and
fumbling along the rail for another loose
splinter.

"She's er likely gal, if I do say it ter you,
Jesse Crow, an' I'd 'a' been mighty glad if she'd
'a' tuk a likin' ter Pink.  She knows how ter
work, an' she ain't afeerd ter put her hand
tu it."

"Her ma hain't sp'ilt her, that's a fact,"
said Mr. Crow, modestly.  "Thar she comes
now," he continued, raising his head, and
glancing across the road.

She had been to the spring, and walked
briskly up the path and across the dusty road,
her sun-bonnet swinging from one hand, a
pail of water poised evenly on her head.  Her
black hair hung in a thick braid down her
back, the sun had tanned her skin to a fine
brown, but there was a ruddy glow in her
cheeks, and full, firm lips.  Her bright, steady
eyes were dark gray, and when she smiled two
rows of even white teeth were disclosed to view.

"A likely" girl indeed, dressed in a neat,
clean cotton gown, its clumsy folds not able
to hide the graceful development of her figure.
She was Jesse Crow's only child, and he
regarded her with a just feeling of pride, and,
though it had now taken a perplexing turn,
felt secretly pleased at her disposition and
ability to have her own way.  Edwards
nodded to her with a friendly smile.

"Mornin', Bet."

"Mornin' Mr. Ed'ards.  How's Mis Ed'ards
and the chillun?" she inquired in a pleasant,
soft-toned voice, pausing at the gate.

"'Bout as common, Bet."

She looked inquiringly at him.  Mr. Edwards
cleared his throat.

"Now, Bet, you ain't goin' ter be onreasonable
'bout this Fannin scrape, air ye?"

A sudden flush passed over her face, and
she lifted the brimming pail from her head and
placed it on the fence.

"Depends on what you mean by that, Mr. Ed'ards,
hopin' you'll take no offence a-talkin'
so plain."

"I mean you ain't a-goin' ter hold up fer him
ag'in everybody else, an' pester yer ma an' pa."

Her lips trembled; she looked at her father.

"Pa knows I ain't a-meanin' ter pester him."

"Yes, honey, we know that," he said, her
appealing glance melting his heart to tenderness
at once.  When had he ever failed to
respond to her joy or sorrow?

"Now, that's Pink, an' Sile Jill, an' Bill
Sanders, an'—"

"Don't be a-namin' Bill Sanders ter me,
Mr. Ed'ards, if yer please," she exclaimed quickly.

"But it ain't fair ter be a-blamin' him fer
Tom Fannin's fault, Betsy," shaking his head
reprovingly.

"How kin I help it, Mr. Ed'ards, when I feel
an' know that in some way or other he's the
cause o' it?" she cried, with a passionate
tremor in her voice.  "It ain't a-hurtin' nobody
fer me ter b'lieve in Tom, spite o' everything,
an' please don't ax me not to, fer I must; I
can't help it."

She opened the gate, and took up the pail
of water and went on into the house, and a few
minutes later the men heard the steady click-clack
of the loom.

All day she sat on the high bench, weaving
steadily a stripe of blue and a stripe of brown,
counting the threads carefully; but her heart
lay heavy in her bosom, and her eyes were
grave.  She had been deeply shocked at the
charge against Tom Fannin, but her faith in
his honesty remained unshaken.  She understood
his faults, his weaknesses, but they only
appealed to her womanly tenderness.  He
was generous, honest, and truthful, and if he
was not so good-looking or so prosperous as
others—Pink Edwards and Bill Sanders, she
loved him.  The heart of woman is past
finding out.  Bet Crow might have had pick and
choice among the beaux of the settlement, and
instead of favoring the suit of one of her smart,
industrious lovers, she chose Tom Fannin, the
poorest, least fortunate young man in the
county.  He had a farm, but it did not
prosper, and his stock were neglected and shabby.

"He's shiftless," said his neighbors, and Bet
knew it to be true, though too loyal even to
acknowledge it to any one but herself.

The shadows were growing long across the
yard, and the soft lowing of the cows, wending
their way home, could be heard, when a step
sounded in the entry, and Tom Fannin himself
walked into the room where Bet sat weaving.

"Mis' Crow said 'Jest walk right in,'" he said,
stopping near the door, holding his hat
awkwardly in his hands.

"Tu be shure, Tom," said the girl, feeling
his new embarrassment acutely, and longing
to put him at his ease and make him understand
that story would not change her regard.
"Jes' take er cheer."

She did not stop her work, and he drew a
chair up near the bench, laid his hat on the
floor, and then for the first time looked
straightly and frankly at her.  His eyes were
clear and honest if not handsome.  Bet felt
his steady look, and flushed, and the hand
holding the shuttle trembled slightly.

"You have heard?" he said at last, with a
deep, dejected sigh.

"Yes," suddenly facing him and looking
into his eyes.  They did not waver, though
his sunburnt face flushed.

"It wus in my pocket, Bet, but if it's the las'
word I'm ever ter say, I don't know how it got
thar," he said, solemnly.

"I know'd you didn't do it," she said with
generous faith.  "Bill Sanders mus' be at the
bottom o' it himself."

"I don't know—I don't know nothin' erbout
the matter 't all.  I can't seem ter understan'
why ennybody'd wanter spile my character,
I've been shiftless an' lazy, I'll 'low that,"
humbly, "an' I don't know as you oughter 'a'
put up with me, but I never tuk nothin' that
didn't berlong ter me, an' never lifted er finger
to harm a human creetur."

His voice shook slightly, and he leaned his
head upon the weaving bench, his face hidden
in a fold of Bet's dress.

She trembled in a passion of tender sympathy;
tears filled her eyes, ran down her face,
but she would not let a single sob pass her
quivering lips.  She laid her hand softly on
his ruddy hair, and when she could speak
without crying, said:

"It'll never make enny difference with me,
I don't care what they say."

"But the whole world'll be turnin' ag'in me
now, Bet.  I've come over to tell you I won't
think hard o' yer fer takin' back yer
promises," he said with an effort.

"Promises air promises, an' I never make 'em
'thout wantin' ter keep 'em," she said steadily.

He raised his head, he saw the tears on her
face, the trembling of her lips, and starting up
threw one arm around her, and pressed her
head against him.

"God A'mighty bless yer, Bet, honey, for
keerin' fer sech a poor creetur as I, when you
mought git the best.  Ef I don't make somethin'
o' myself now arter this, I'll never ax
yer to keep yer word," he whispered, passionately
pressing his rough cheek against her
smooth, warm one.

For a moment the girl did not move, then
she gently removed his arm, and sitting
upright began to look confusedly for her shuttle,
flushing, paling, not daring to meet her lover's
eyes.

"Can't nothin' be done to clear up the
matter?" she said finally in a low tone.

Fannin shook his head sadly.

"Nothin'; it wus thar, an' I hain't no way
o' provin' I didn't put it thar."

That was true, and gossip was rife throughout
the settlement, and the members of Cool
Spring Church met in solemn conclave to
"deal" with the erring young man, who
persisted in denying his guilt, thereby adding the
sin of a lie to the sin of stealing.  He lost his
situation on the railroad, he lost his friends,
and seemed to sink to the lowest ebb of fortune.
But his trials put a new spirit into him,
or else called forth a great deal of latent
strength, for he met the slights of his associates
and neighbors with quiet dignity and went
to work energetically on his farm.

"I 'lowed you 'ud be a-huntin' a new home,"
said one of his neighbors to him, eying him
curiously.

"No, I'm goin' ter stay right t' hum," he replied
doggedly.

"He's er turrible sinner," said the gossips
on learning his determination to remain at his
old home.

Those long summer days were wretched
ones to Bet Crow.  She devised a thousand
plans for clearing her lover, but they all came
to naught.  She firmly believed Bill Sanders
had caused the trouble, though why or how
she could not determine.  He had been one of
her most ardent admirers, and betrayed as
much anger as disappointment when she
refused to "keep cump'ny" with him, but she
did not connect that with Tom's disgrace.
After that one afternoon visit her lover did not
come again to see her, and if they met
accidentally at church or elsewhere, they only
exchanged the briefest and quietest greeting,
but eyes may speak as well as lips, and there
were glances eloquent and sweet to both.

Bet did not parade her feelings, and people
said she had come to her senses at last, and
had sent "that triflin' Tom Fannin erdrift."

One day Bill Sanders stepped boldly up
and asked permission to walk home from
meeting with her.  She curtly refused.

"What's the matter, Bet?  It's onjest to
treat me in sech er way 'thout er cause," he
said in wounded tones.

"You know I can't be a-wantin' enny o'
yer comp'ny," she said, and before the
righteous anger of her eyes he shrank back
abashed.

The summer passed slowly—dewy dawns,
languid sunlit noons, and dusky evenings.
The corn ripened, and the cotton-fields
promised a fair yield.  Tom Fannin worked
steadily, early and late, as though finding in
constant occupation a panacea for his troubles.

"He'll soon git tired o' that; min' what I
say," said one prophet, "an' go ter idlin' round
ag'in."

But he did not, growing thin and brawny
with constant toil.  But the change had come
too late.  The charge of theft could neither be
forgiven nor forgotten in that community.

Farmer Crow carefully refrained from
mentioning Tom Fannin's name to his daughter
since the morning he sat on the fence and
talked with Mr. Jim Edwards.  But his
shrewd, kindly eyes observed the young man's
demeanor with approval.

"He's got more grit than we calkerlated
on," he mused.

At last he broached the subject to Bet.

"It's a pity Tom Fannin sp'ilt his fortune
a-takin' that money; he's a-doin' so mighty well
now."

Bet looked reproachfully at him.  "How do
you know he took it, pa?"

"How do we know he didn't, Bet?  Honey,
don't be a-deceivin' yerself.  I'm mighty proud
you have dropped his comp'ny."

"I hain't dropped it, pa.  We er jest a-waitin'."

He sighed.

"You air pow'fully sot in yer ways, Bet, fer
er young creetur."

"Pa, I mought as well give up livin' as ter
give up Tom.  You know how 'tis," her eyes
traveling to the round, placid face of her
mother sitting out in the entry, knitting.

Her father's face softened.

"Well, well, honey, don't do nothin' you'll
be sorry fer, that's all I ax.  Waitin' is
sometimes a mighty tryin' thing."

"But it mus' be better'n not havin'
anything ter wait fer," she said, solemnly.

But as time passed monotonously, without
bringing any vindication of her lover's name,
and hope died slowly and painfully, she
learned the bitterness of waiting.

It was "fodder-pullin'" time, and the
farmers were out from dawn until evening stripping
the yellowing blades from the stalk, tying
it, and stacking it in the wide hot fields.
The new railroad skirted the western bounds
of Mr. Jesse Crow's farm, and through the
almost breathless stillness could be heard the
ring of hammer and steel from the bridge
building over Cool Spring Creek.  Some of
the strange workmen had a reputation for
lawlessness quite shocking to the simple,
peaceable country people.

It was about the middle of the afternoon,
and Bet Crow was spinning listlessly, while
her mother carded the rolls for her.  They
were not dreaming of any danger, when a
man, coatless, hatless, covered with dust,
and panting heavily, leaped the fence and ran
across the yard.  It was Bill Sanders.

"Mis' Crow, for the love of God let me hide
in here!" he gasped hoarsely, stumbling over
the doorstep, and then staggering into the room.

"Bill Sanders! what on the face o' the
yeth!" cried the frightened woman, her
fresh-colored face growing pale.

"They air arter me! they mean to kill me!"
he panted, crouching under the loom, quivering
with exhaustion, wild-eyed with fear.

"Bet, Bet! what does it mean?" exclaimed
her mother appealingly.

Bet ran to the door, and shading her eyes
with her hand, looked out.  Four or five men
were running along the road toward the
house, searching and cursing fiercely.  She
had no idea what had happened, but she knew
they were workmen from the bridge, and a
desperate-looking gang they were to her
frightened eyes.  For a moment her heart
quailed.  They might murder her and her
mother, as well as Bill Sanders.  He was
incapable of offering any defense just then, and
pity filled her heart.  Her eyes flashed; her
lips were set in a determined line.  They
should not get him if she could help it.

"Quick, ma! blow the horn for pa!" she said,
then sprang up on a chair and took down her
father's shot-gun from over the door, a trusty
weapon he loved next to his wife and daughter.

"Don't you come enny nigher till you tell
what you want," she said clearly, raising the
gun in her none too steady hands as they
scrambled over the fence.  For a moment they
were nonplussed, and stared at her with a
mixture of surprise and uncertainty.

"We want the man that's hid in there," said
one lowering fellow, fiercely.

"What for?"

"To hang to the nearest tree."

"What's he been a-doin'?"

"Killin' a friend of our'n down on the railroad."

The horror of it almost took her breath, but
she maintained her defensive attitude bravely.

"That's er turrible thing," she said, praying
that every blast of the horn would bring her
father.

"See here, young woman, you'd better get
outen that and let us have him.  We don't
mean no harm to you, but we ain't got time
to argue with you."

"I'm plum' sorry for you, but I'm bound ter
do what I kin fer the law.  We air peaceable
folks here, an' like ter be punished 'cordin' ter
law.  If you'll git the jestice o' the peace an'
have Mr. Sanders tuk ter jail, I ain't no objections."

Their wrath was evidently cooling somewhat,
and they were forced to a reluctant
admiration of her pluck.

If they had known that she was trembling
like a leaf, that her arms were feeling nerveless
and weak, her eyes dim!  She knew that she
could not hold out much longer in that threatening
attitude.  A moment of dead silence fell
while the men consulted in whispers, and Bet
could hear the deep, hurried breathing of the
hidden man, and the horrified moans and
ejaculations of her mother with a distinctness
absolutely painful to her.  But help had come.
Her strained eyes wandered despairingly from
those dark, angry faces confronting her, and
she saw her father and two or three other men
coming through the lot.

Matters were at last peaceably adjusted.
Mr. Crow argued so mildly and reasonably with
the avenging party that they consented—the
farmers bearing them company—to take
their prisoner and allow the law to deal with
him.

"But I'll tell you what, Sanders, you owe
your life to that girl.  We would 'a' killed you,
sure, if she hadn't 'a' stood up in your defense
like she did.  We didn't want to hurt her," said
one of the men grimly, and Sanders groaned
heavily.  He gave Bet one humbly grateful
glance as they led him away.

The whole occurrence occupied but a brief
space of time in the bright summer day.  The
dust settled softly upon the road behind the
retreating footsteps of the self-appointed posse
and their prisoner, and the crickets shrilling in
the grass seemed the only living thing left.
Bet sank down on the doorstep, and hid her
face in her hands, faint and weak from the strain
upon her nerves.

"Drink this, honey, it'll do you good," said
her mother, holding a brimming gourd of water
to her pale lips, and she drank a little and
declared that she felt better.

"Do you s'pose they'll hang him, Bet?" in
a fearful whisper.

"I don't know, ma, if he's tuk human life—"
she paused with a shudder.

A new sensation had been furnished the
settlement, and a far greater one than the mere
theft of a little money.  The men met to
discuss the crime, and the women spoke of it in
low, awestruck tones.  Then it was discovered
that the man had not been killed, but badly
wounded and stunned.  A quieter spirit
prevailed, and when it came out that the stranger
had struck the first blow, and that Sanders had
only acted on the defensive, the tide of public
sympathy turned in his favor.

It does not belong to this story to go into
all the details of the trial held at the
September term of the county court.  It is enough to
say the young man was acquitted and walked
out of the court-room free, but subdued and
quiet.  He went direct to Farmer Crow's, and
walked into the room where Bet sat with her
patchwork.  She greeted him with grave
kindness, and asked him to sit down, but he
declined, preferring to stand.  He twisted the
flexible willow switch he carried, nervously around
in his hands, and swallowed audibly, as though
something choked him.

"They'd 'a' tuk my life shure in their first
mad fit if it hadn't 'a' been for you, Bet," he said
finally, with an effort.  "I don't know what to
say; I ain't much fer words, but—"

"Please don't say nothin' 'bout it, Bill," she
pleaded in great embarrassment.  "Folks air
a-puttin' what I done up too high.  If I helped you
it wasn't nothin' more'n duty, seein' as you was
plum' tuckered out with runnin'.  I'd 'a' done it
fer ennybody."

"Don't I know that better'n you, Bet?" he
exclaimed bitterly.  "Don't I know you can't bear
the sight o' me? but I'm a-goin' to show you that
I ain't ungrateful fer what you've done fer me."

He passed his hands over his eyes.  "Bet, I
done somethin' for you that for yer sake I'm
now a-goin' ter undo.  Next Sunday is meetin'
day at Cool Spring, an' I'm a-goin' ter make
public acknowledgments o' my temptations,
an' the doin's o' Satan in my heart.  I've
keered for you mighty nigh to the ruination o' my
hopes fer a better world.  But if God A'mighty
kin fergive me, then you kin tu, Bet.  Good-evenin'."

He turned to go.  She sprang up, scattering
her quilt pieces right and left.

"Bill!" she gasped, but he strode hastily
out of the room, mounted his horse, and rode
away.

The last song had been sung and the
congregation at Cool Spring church were about
to rise to receive the benediction when Bill
Sanders stood up, and clearing his throat,
looked around on the people.  As he met the
curious expectant eyes fixed upon him, he
seemed to waver—to flinch from his purpose.

"Now speak out, Brother Sanders," said the
pastor encouragingly, and the kindly voice of
the old man gave him fresh strength.

"Broth'r'n an' sist'r'n, it becomes my duty
ter tell you o' the temptations I've be'n
a-fallin' under this year, an' ter ax yer
forgiveness an' yer prayers.  I've be'n a-wanderin'
fur from the right way.  I done er turrible
thing ter brother Tom Fannin—took away his
good name, an' made him a byword an' en
example o' evil among you.  Fer the sake o'
one who it ain't becomin' in me ter name here,
an' who ain't ter blame any more'n a innocent
child, I 'lowed myself ter hate him—ter wanter
cast disfavor 'pon him."

He paused, and a pinfall might have been
heard in that church, so intensely quiet, so
breathless were the excited people.  He
looked at Tom Fannin leaning forward eagerly
on his seat, then his eyes rested for a moment
on Bet Crow's drooping face, and he could
almost feel the quick flutter of the pulse in her
round soft throat.  His eyes sank to the floor;
he drew a long breath.

"Broth'r'n, this is er public acknowledgment,
an' the solemn, bindin' truth—I put that
money in Tom Fannin's pocket with my own
hands."

He said no more, but sat down and hid his
face in his hands, and a stir and murmur
seemed to sweep over the church like a wave.
The agitation, excitement, seemed about to
break dignified Christian bounds, when
Mr. Jesse Crow rose and solemnly said:

"Broth'r'n, we have all heard the public
acknowledgments o' Brother Sanders's wrong-doin'.
He has tole it 'thout bein' axed, an' o'
his own free will an' inclernation.  In dealin'
with this errin' brother we mus' bear in min'
thar air allus extinguishin' sarcumstances
surroundin' ever' deed done by weak mortal
creeturs, an' a confession o' guilt is er long way
to'ards complete repentance."

Well, that public confession was the climax
of that year of events in the Cool Spring
settlement, if I except the wedding at Mr. Jesse
Crow's, later in the season, when house and
yard overflowed with guests, and all united
in giving a kindly hand and a hearty word to
the bridegroom.  Bill Sanders was not
present.  He had gone out West to seek a new
home, and let us hope that he was in time as
happy as Tom Fannin and his wife, once the
belle of Cool Spring settlement—Bet Crow.

   STORY OF A MOONSHINER'S DAUGHTER.

.. vspace:: 2

Silury Cole threw a fresh pine-knot on
the fire and stepped to the door to peer out
into the night, listening intently for the first
sound of her father's footsteps on the hard
mountain road.  For two days the revenue
officers had been abroad on the mountains,
and the hearts of women and children were
heavy with terror and dread.

The rich pine kindled, burnt into vivid
flame, throwing its light upon the girl from
head to foot, on her smooth hair, black as the
night, on the profile of her face, denoting
unusual character for a girl of fourteen, and on
her primitively fashioned gown of blue checked
cotton.

The rioting flames, filling the black cavernous
depths of the fireplace, lighted up the
low room also, throwing grotesque shadows
behind the loom and spinning-wheel, lingering
round the flaxen heads of the three children
asleep on the low trundle bed, glancing
over the basket of corn ready to be shelled
for the miller, and over the table and simple
preparations for supper.

Mrs. Cole sat in the corner at one end of
the flat stone hearth, smoking and silently
brooding.  She was a small, sickly looking
woman with sunken eyes and sharp, delicate
features.  She leaned forward with her chin
resting in one hand, staring into the fire.  A
stick of wood burned apart and fell softly to
the coals underneath.  She started and glanced
at Silury.

"Is he comin', Silury?"

"Not yet, ma."

She refilled her pipe and laid a glowing coal
on it, shaking her head slowly.

"An' not likely to till the revenue men
have gone away."

"Ah, but don't you know, ma, pa never
stays away mor'n two days at a time?  Recollect
the time he come a-whistlin' with his gun
on his shoulder, an' the raiders just down on
the mill road," said Silury, and laughed at
the remembrance of his daring.  "Pa ain't
easily scared."

"That's so, an' I remember that he was
mighty hungry, too," murmured her mother,
a faint smile, for a moment, lighting up her
prematurely wrinkled face.

Silury glanced over her shoulder at the
oven of potatoes steaming on the hearth, and
the frying-pan filled with fresh-cut rashers of
bacon ready to place over the fire.  Her
preparations were all complete.  When he came
it would take but a few minutes to place a
smoking hot supper, such as he loved, before him.

"Are the children covered up?" her mother
inquired, glancing toward the bed.  "These
October nights are gettin' cold."

Silury stepped across the room and tucked
the cover around the young sleepers.  No
wonder her face had such a mature look—she
moved with such a womanly air—the cares of
the household nearly all fell upon her.  She
was the pride of her father's heart, her mother
depended on her, and the younger children
always looked to her to supply their needs.
Mrs Cole relapsed into her former attitude,
for a few minutes, then suddenly raised her
head, a look of fear flashing into her dull
eyes.  "Silury, it 'pears to me I hear
somethin'," she whispered quickly.

The girl hurried back to the door, and
leaned out again, her head slightly bent, one
hand lifted to her ear in a listening attitude.
A gust of wind swept down the black serried
peaks, so high above the small cabin, so
sharply cut against the starlit sky, hurrying
on its erratic course to the valley.  The cow
munched dry corn husks in a corner of the
fence, and Kit, the mule, pawed restlessly at
the stable door.  But none of those sounds
had disturbed Mrs. Cole, roused that fear in
her.  Far away Silury heard the steady beat
of hoofs upon the dry, hard road, as of a horse
newly shod, and urged to his utmost speed.

"I 'low it's only somebody ridin' fer the
doctor," she said soothingly, but a line, drawn
by keenest anxiety, appeared between her
dark brows.  The sound came upward from
the valley, not downward from the mountains.
It drew nearer each moment, bringing glad or
evil tidings to some lone dweller on the
heights, for no one ever traveled over the
mountains in that way simply for the pleasure
of it.  How swift, how steady, fell the
iron-shod feet upon the earth! now clear and
distinct, as they passed along a ridge, now
almost lost as they plunged into a ravine.  The
big liver-colored hound, lying on the
doorstep, stood up, sniffed the air, and howled
mournfully.

"It may be the raiders," muttered Mrs. Cole
restlessly.

"Or somebody's dead, an' they er comin' fer
their folks," said Silury in awed tones.

She could hear the heavy panting of the
horse, as, with slackened gait, he came up the
hollow below the house, and see an outline of
the rider as they turned the lot fence; then, as
they crossed the narrow path of light projected
from the doorway beyond the low yard fence,
she recognized a valley neighbor.  He scarcely
halted, as he excitedly cried:

"Silury, the raiders got yer pa—took him
over in Jimson's Brake, along with Peleg White,
an' one o' the Davis boys.  They'll pass
Buckhorn Springs to-night."

And then he went on his way, to carry the
sad news to more remote habitations; and great
silence seemed to fall upon the mountain-side.
Silury and her mother looked speechlessly at
one another, then Mrs. Cole passed a trembling
hand confusedly over her face.

"What all did he say, Silury?  It 'pears to
me my understandin' ain't quite clear to-night."

"He said—" she caught her breath in a sob.
"Oh, ma! the raiders have took pa; what shall
we do, what shall we do?  Poor pa! it will kill
him to be put in prison!" in a burst of
despairing anguish.

Mrs. Cole crouched lower in her chair.

"I knew it would come.  I've been a-feelin'
it here for a long time—a long time," one thin
hand groping for her heart.  "Yes, he'll pine
fer his freedom an' the mountings when he's
shut up in jail.  Oh, I've begged him not to be
a moonshiner—not to make whiskey on the sly.
They all have to suffer fer it sooner or later."  Her
wandering, tearful eyes fell on the waiting
supper.  "How hungry he must be!"

There were no noisy demonstrations, but a
grief, pathetic as it was deep.  They were
mountaineers, patient by nature, and schooled
by all the circumstances of life to endure and
be strong.  The law does not punish the moonshiner
alone, but it falls heavily on his wife and
children.  Silury dried her eyes and touched
her mother on the shoulder, speaking in a
firmer tone:

"I must go down to Buckhorn Springs to-night, ma."

"Eh?" said the dazed woman.

"I must see pa; I must help him to get away
from the raiders."

"You, Silury!  How'll you do it?"

"I don't know," her lips trembling again,
"but I must do it—I must!"

Mrs. Cole stared at her.  She had faith in
Silury's courage and ability, but now she caught
the girl's hand, fresh terror seizing her.

"Don't you get into trouble, honey.  Me an'
the children would perish if your pa an' you
were both took off."

"Don't you fret, ma; I'll come back to you
an' bring pa, too."

"How'll you get to Buckhorn Springs?"

"Ride Kit."

She was already down on her knees before
the fire, kindling a torch to take out to the lot
with her.  She looked up at her mother with
brave, tender eyes.

"Now, don't pester yerself any more'n you
can help, ma."

Mrs. Cole shook her head with a deep sigh,
and instinctively reached for her pipe, but she
could only sit and hold it in her hand, unfilled,
unlighted, while Silury went away to the lot
with the flaring torch and an old saddle thrown
on her arm.

Kit was a shabby beast, thin, wiry, and with
only one good eye, but he had served the Coles
faithfully.  He greeted the young girl with a
gentle whinny, and she leaned her head against
him with another burst of tears.  But she
quickly wiped them away, and led Kit out to
the road.  It did not take her long to put bridle
and saddle on him, then she ran in, took down
her father's rifle from the rack over the front
door, and in a few minutes had started on her
solitary ride down the mountains.  The hound
would have followed her, but she ordered him
back.  "Go back, Bolivar, an' take care o'
them that's left behind," and he slunk
unwillingly to the doorstep again.

It was a night to live in the child's memory
all her life, for with all her fearlessness and
hard training she had never before been called
upon to traverse the mountain passes alone
after darkness had fallen upon them.  Solitude
and gloom surrounded her.  The valley seemed
but a formless gulf of darkness, the
multitudinous mountains, black sentinels, towering
to the stars.  Far away in some remote
fastness of the mountains a dog barked, and she
could hear the prolonged blast of a hunting
horn.  A star shot downward from the zenith,
leaving a trail of fire across the sky, and was
lost behind the far-reaching western ranges.  A
sense of isolation oppressed her.  She seemed
the only living human creature in all the vast,
silent world.  On the saddle in front of her she
held the trusty rifle, and that gave her a sense
of security from beasts of prey.  Her father
had taught her how to use the gun, and
practice had given her an almost unerring aim.
But my young readers will acknowledge that it
was a trying situation for even a mountain girl,
to ride alone through ravines and over declivities,
often only a bridle path to guide her.  It
required a brave heart and a steady nerve.

Buckhorn Springs are on the public highway
leading from a market town in North Georgia to
Murphy, North Carolina, and traditions of the
wonderful medicinal qualities of the water
come down, even from the remote days when
the Indian set up the poles of his wigwam near
the springs, and slaked his thirst in their cool,
healing streams, flowing out from under
Buckhorn Mountain.  The Indian and his wigwam are
mere traditions now themselves, and the white
man and his covered market wagon have taken
their places.  It has been the favorite camping-ground
of the mountaineers coming from or going
to market since the first white settlers
boldly penetrated the wilderness beyond.
Campers were there the night the revenue officers
were to pass with Amaziah Cole, Peleg White,
and young Davis.  They were on the roadside,
their white covered wagon drawn out under
the sparse timber, their sleek red oxen lying
unyoked near it.  A camp-fire of brushwood
and pine-knots blazed up in the open space
between the timber and the road, throwing
strange eerie shadows against the mountain-side,
and in the tree-tops above.

A lean, brown-faced wagoner sat on an
inverted feed-box whittling a stick, and a woman
occupied a rude camp-stool nearer the fire, the
light bringing out the stripes in her brown and
yellow homespun skirts, and the melancholy
lines in her sharp-featured face.  A brown
woolen veil was tied around her head, and she
rubbed snuff with subdued enjoyment.  Silury
did not go down to the public road.  On the
mountain-side, above the springs, a ledge of
gray rocks jutted out.  Dismounting at a level
spot in the pathway, Silury tied Kit's bridle to
an overhanging bough, then with the gun
grasped in her hands, she crept through the
underbrush to the rocks.  She trembled with
excitement, for a daring thought had come to
her—a scheme whereby she might deliver her
father from his captors.  She crouched down
behind the rocks, and waited, praying that she
might be calm, that her eye might be true, her
hand steady when the time came.

Evidently the campers had heard of the
raid, and were intending to sit up until the
officers passed with the prisoners, for several
times, during that lagging hour of suspense
Silury spent behind the boulders, the man
walked out into the road to listen for sounds
of travel.

"I 'low they are comin' at last," he said,
closing his knife with a sharp click, and his
wife put up her snuff-box and joined him on
the roadside.

Silury's heart gave a great thump, thump,
against her side.  She started into a more
erect position, bringing the barrel of her rifle
to a level with the rock.  The tramping sound
of horses' feet could be distinctly heard on
the road, and presently the cavalcade rode
up, the prisoners in the middle.  The officers
were feeling comparatively secure.  No rescue
had ever been attempted at Buckhorn Springs.
Friends of prisoners had sometimes ambushed
in the wilder country above, but this raid
had been unmolested.  They had been riding
hard, and so they halted for a few minutes at
the springs, and some of them dismounted for
a drink.

Silury saw her father astride a powerful
mule, his hands tied together, but his lower
limbs free.  He looked haggard and unkempt,
his long, black hair falling to his shoulders,
his beard tangled.  He bore the marks of his
sojourn in Jimson's Brake, and of his resistance
to arrest.

"Poor pa!"

Did he hear that trembling, pitying
whisper?  He threw up his head, his black,
deep-set eyes flashing an eager glance around.
The officer at his side fell back a little to
speak to a comrade.  It was the girl's chance.
She suddenly rose head and shoulders above
the rocks, the camp-fire shining on her white
face and bare head.

"Look out, pa! look out!" she screamed
in shrill, piercing tones, and fired.

He saw her, read her purpose and, as the
animal under him staggered and fell, he
leaped from its back like a panther, and
disappeared in the underbrush.

It was all so quick, so unexpected!  Through
the curling wreath of smoke from the rifle,
Silury's face appeared for a moment to the
amazed eyes of the officers; then they realized
what had happened, and fearing a stronger
attack, put spurs to their horses and hustled
their other prisoners away, leaving the dead
mule in the road.

The next morning, as the rising sun gilded
the mountain tops with gold, the revenue
officers rode through the streets of the market
town with two prisoners, telling a thrilling
story of the moonshiners' ambush at Buckhorn
Springs and the escape of Amaziah Cole.

It was about that same time that Silury
stood again on the doorstep of home, her face
aglow, her eyes radiant, in spite of the
sleepless night spent abroad on the mountains.
Bolivar crouched against her feet, or licked
her hands in his joy at her return, but she
scarcely noticed him.  She was looking at the
unfinished supper, cold on the hearth, the
gray, fireless ashes in the deep fireplace, and
her mother asleep in her chair.

"Wake up, ma! wake up!" she cried, joyously;
"pa is here!"

Mrs. Cole started up and rubbed her eyes
as she saw her husband and daughter
standing in the doorway.  "Did I dream it all?"
she murmured helplessly.  "I thought the
raiders were takin' you to jail, Amaziah."

"So they were, an' I'd be there right now
ef—" he stopped, choked with emotion, and his
hand stroked Silury's head.

"An' he's never goin' to be a moonshiner
again, ma, never!  Ain't we glad!" and Silury
slipped across the floor to wake the younger
children.  Her father's proud eyes followed
her.

"It's all owin' to you, all owin' to you,
Silury."

He lived alone in a weather-beaten
log-cabin built on the roadside at the edge of a
rocky, sterile field, with a few stunted
peach-trees growing around it, and a wild grape-vine
half covering the one slender oak shading
the front yard.  The house consisted of only
one room, with a wide, deep fireplace in the
north end, and a wide window to the south.
The logs had shrunk apart, leaving airy cracks
in the walls, and the front door creaked on
one hinge, the other having rusted away.

But 'Zeki'l Morgan's ambition seemed
satisfied when he came into possession of the
house, the unproductive clearing around it,
and the narrow strip of woodland bounding
the richer farm beyond.  From the cabin door
could be seen the broken, picturesque hills
marking the course of the Etowah River, with
the Blue Ridge Mountains far beyond, and
the Long Swamp range rising in the foreground.

Very little of 'Zeki'l's past history was
known in Zion Hill settlement.  He had
walked into Mr. Davy Tanner's store one
spring day, a dusty, penniless tramp, his
clothes hanging loosely from his stooping
shoulders, a small bundle in one hand, a rough
walking-stick in the other.  Mr. Davy
Tanner was a soft-hearted old man, and the
forlorn, friendless stranger appealed strangely to
his sympathy, in spite of his candid statement
that he had just finished a five-years' term in
the penitentiary for horse-stealing.

"I tell you this, not because I think it's
anything to boast of, but because I don't want
to 'pear like I'm deceivin' folks," he said in
a dejected, melancholy tone, his face
twitching, his eyes cast down.  It was a haggard
face, bleached to a dull pallor by prison life,
every feature worn into deep lines.  Evidently
he had suffered beyond the punishment of the
law, though how far it had eaten into his soul
no man would ever learn, for after that simple
statement of his crime and his servitude as a
convict, he did not again, even remotely,
touch upon his past, nor the inner history of
his life.  No palliative explanations were
offered, no attempts made to soften the bare,
disgraceful truth.

Mr. Davy Tanner was postmaster as well as
merchant, and his store was the general
rendezvous for the settlement.  The women came
to buy snuff, and thread, and such cheap,
simple materials as they needed for Sunday
clothes; the men to get newspapers and the
occasional letters coming for them, besides
buying sugar and coffee, and talking over
the affairs of the county and of Zion Hill
church.

They looked on 'Zeki'l Morgan with distrust
and contempt, and held coldly aloof from
him.  But at last a farmer, sorely in need of
help, ventured to hire him, after talking it
over with Mr. Davy Tanner.

"I tell you there ain't a mite o' harm in him."

"S'pose he runs away with my horse, Mr. Tanner?"

"I'll stand for him ef he does," said
Mr. Davy Tanner, firmly.  "I don't know any
more th'n you about him, but I'm willin' to
trust him."

"That's the way you treat most o' the folks
that come about you," said his neighbor,
smiling.

"Well, I ain't lost anything by it.  It puts
a man on his mettle to trust him—gives him
self-respect, if there's any good in him."

All the year 'Zeki'l filled a hireling's place,
working faithfully; but the next year he
bought a steer, a few sticks of furniture, and,
renting the cabin and rocky hillside from
Mr. Davy Tanner, set up housekeeping, a yellow
cur and an old violin his companions.  Then
he managed to buy the place, and settled down.
On one side he had the Biggers place, a fine,
rich farm, and on the other Mr. Davy
Tanner's store and Zion Hill church.  He
attended the church regularly, but always sat
quietly, unobtrusively in a corner, an alien, a man
forever set apart from other men.

As the years passed, openly expressed
distrust and prejudice died out, though he was
never admitted to the inner life of the
settlement.  He did not seem to expect it, going
his way quietly, and ever maintaining an
impenetrable reserve about his own private
history.  Not even Mr. Davy Tanner could win
him from that reticence, much as he desired to
learn all about those long years of penal
servitude and the life concealed behind them.  He
seemed to be without any ties of kindred or
friendship, for the mail never brought
anything to him, not even a newspaper.

   "A DUSTY, PENNILESS TRAMP."

But he seemed a kindly natured man, with
a vein of irrepressible sociability running
through him, in spite of his solitary ways of
life.  There were glimpses of humor occasionally,
and had it not been for that cloud of
shame hanging forbiddingly over him, he
would have become a favorite with his neighbors.

Across the road, opposite his house, he set
up a small blacksmith shop, and much of his
idle time he spent in there, mending broken
tools, sharpening dull plows, hammering
patiently on the ringing red-hot iron.  The
smallest, simplest piece of work received the
most careful attention, and the farmers
recognized and appreciated his conscientiousness.

One summer afternoon, as he was plowing
in his cotton-field, a neighbor came along the
road and, stopping at the fence, hailed him.
He plowed to the end of the row, and halted.

"Good evenin', 'Zeki'l," said the man,
mounting to the top of the fence, and sitting
with his heels thrust through a crack in the
lower rails.

"Howdy you do, Marshall?  What's the
news down your way?" 'Zeki'l inquired, drawing
his shirt-sleeve across his face, and leaning
on the plow-handles.

"I don't know as there's much to tell.
Billy Hutchins an' Sary Ann McNally run
away an' got married last night, an' old Mis'
Gillis is mighty nigh dead with the ja'nders.
A punkin couldn't look yallerer."  He opened
his knife, and ran his fingers along the rail in
search of a splinter to whittle.  "Old man
Biggers has sold his place at last."

"Has he?"

"Yes; I met him down at the store, an' he
said the trade had been made."

"He's bound to go to Texas."

"Yes; so he 'lows."

"Well, old Georgy is good enough for me,"
'Zeki'l remarked, with a pleased glance at his
sterile fields.

"An' for me," said Marshall, heartily.
"Wanderin' 'round don't make folks rich.
Biggers owns the best place in this settlement,
an' he'd better stay on it.  It won't do to
believe all the tales they tell about these
new States.  I had a brother go to Louisiany
before the war.  Folks said, 'Don't take
anything with you; why, money mighty nigh
grows on bushes out there.'  His wife took the
greatest pride in her feather beds, but what
would be the use o' haulin' them beds all the
way across the Mississippi, when you could
rake up feathers by the bushel anywheres?
Well, they went, an' for the whole endurin'
time they stayed they had to sleep on moss
mattresses, an' my brother 'lowed it was about
the meanest stuff to kill he ever struck.  If
you didn't bile it, an' bury it, an' do the Lord
only knows what to it, it would grow an' burst
out of the beds when you was sleepin' on
'em."  'Zeki'l's attention did not follow those
reminiscent remarks.  "Who bought the
Biggers place?" he inquired, as soon as Marshall
ceased speaking.

"A man he met in Atlanta when he went
down the last time, a man from one of the
lower counties, an' his name—why, yes, to be
sure, it's Morgan, same as yours—'Lijy
Morgan.  May be you know him?" with a sharp,
questioning glance.

But the momentary flush of emotion that
the stranger's name had called to 'Zeki'l's face
was gone.

"I don't know as I do," he slowly replied,
staring at a scrubby cotton-stalk the muzzled
ox was making ineffectual attempts to eat.

"I 'lowed may be he might be some kin to
you," said Marshall, in a baffled tone.

"I don't know as he is," said 'Zeki'l, still in
that slow, dry, non-committal tone, his eyes
leaving the cotton-stalk to follow the swift,
noiseless flight of a cloud-shadow across a
distant hillside.  "Morgan isn't an uncommon
name, you know."

"That's so," reluctantly admitted Marshall.

"When does Mr. Biggers think o' goin' to
Texas?"

"Oh, not until after crops are gathered."

"The other family, isn't to come, then, right
away?"

"No; not till fall."

After Marshall had whittled, and gossiped,
and gone his way, 'Zeki'l stood a long time
with his hands resting on the plow-handles,
his brows drawn together in deep thought.
Some painful struggle seemed to be going on.
The crickets shrilled loudly in the brown
sedge bordering a dry ditch, and a vulture
sailed majestically round and round above the
field, his broad black wings outspread on the
quivering air.  The cloud-shadows on the
river-hills assumed new form, shifted, swept
away, and others came in their places, and the
vulture had become a mere speck, a floating
mote in the upper sunlight, before he turned
the patient ox into another furrow, murmuring
aloud:

"I didn't go to them, an' if they come to
me, I can't help it.  I am not to blame; the
Almighty knows I'm not to blame;" and his
overcast face cleared somewhat.

That night when Mr. Davy Tanner closed
his store and went home, he said to his wife:

"'Zeki'l Morgan must be lonesome, or pestered
about somethin'.  You'd think that old
fiddle o' his could talk an' cry too, from the
way he's playin'."

The season advanced; crops were gathered,
and the shorn fields looked brown and bare.
A sere, withering frost touched the forests, and
the leaves fell in drifts, while the partridge
called to his mate from fence and sedgy covert.
A light snowfall lay on the distant mountains
when the Biggerses started to the West and
the new family of Morgans moved into Zion
Hill settlement.

It was the third day after their arrival.
'Zeki'l leaned over the front gate with an
armful of corn, feeding two fat pigs, when 'Lijy
Morgan passed along the road on his way to
Mr. Davy Tanner's store.  He was a strong-looking,
well-built man, with rugged features
and hair partly gray.  He looked curiously at
the solitary, stooping figure inside the gate,
his steps slackened, then he stopped
altogether, a grayish pallor overspreading the
healthy, ruddy hue of his face.

"'Zeki'l!"

'Zeki'l dropped the corn, and thrust open the gate.

"Howdy you do, 'Lijy?"

.. _`"HOWDY YOU DO, 'LIJY?"`:

.. figure:: images/img-159.jpg
   :figclass: white-space-pre-line
   :align: center
   :alt: "HOWDY YOU DO, 'LIJY?"

   "HOWDY YOU DO, 'LIJY?"

Their hands met in a quick, close grip, then
fell apart.

"I like not to have known you, 'Zeki'l, it
was so unexpected seein' you here," said 'Lijy,
huskily, scanning the worn, deeply lined face
before him with glad yet shrinking gaze.

"An' twelve years make a great difference
in our looks sometimes, though you are not so
much changed," said 'Zeki'l quietly.  He had
been prepared for the meeting, and years of
self-mastery had given him the power of
concealing emotion.

"Twelve years?  Yes; but it has seemed
like twenty to me since—since it all happened.
Why didn't you come home, 'Zeki'l, when
your time was out?"

"I 'lowed the sight o' me wouldn't be good
for you, 'Lijy; an'—an' the old folks were gone."

"Yes; it killed them, 'Zeki'l, it killed them,"
in a choked voice.

"I know," said 'Zeki'l, hastily, his face
blanching; "an' I thought it would be best
to make a new start in a new settlement."

"Do the folks here know?"

"That I served my time?  Yes; but that's
all.  When I heard that you had bought the
Biggers place I studied hard about movin'
away, but I like it here.  It's beginnin' to
seem like home."

'Lijy stared at the poor cabin, the stunted,
naked peach-trees, so cold and dreary-looking
in the wintry dusk.

"Is it yours, 'Zeki'l?"

"Yes; it's mine, all mine.  Come in and sit
awhile with me, an' warm.  It's goin' to be a
nippin' cold night."

He turned, and 'Lijy silently followed him
across the bare yard and into the house.  A
flickering fire sent its warm glow throughout
the room, touching its meagre furnishing with
softening grace, but a chill struck to 'Lijy
Morgan's heart as he crossed the threshold—a chill
of desolation.

"Do you live here alone?"

"Yes; all alone, except Rover and the fiddle."

The cur rose up from the hearth with a wag
of his stumpy tail, and gave the visitor a glance
of welcome from his mild, friendly eyes.

There were only two chairs in the room, and
'Zeki'l placed the best one before the fire for
his guest, then threw on some fresh pieces of
wood.  Outside the dusky twilight deepened
to night, the orange glow fading from the
west, and the stars shining brilliantly through
the clear atmosphere.  The chill wind whistled
around the chimney-corners and through
the chinks in the log walls.

Between the men a constrained silence fell.
The meeting had been painful beyond the
open acknowledgment of either.  The dog
crept to his master's side and thrust his nose
into his hand.  The touch roused 'Zeki'l.
From the jamb he took a cob pipe and a twist
of tobacco.

"Will you smoke, 'Lijy?"

"I believe not; but I'll take a chew."

He cut off a liberal mouthful, and then 'Zeki'l
filled and lighted his pipe.  It seemed to
loosen his tongue somewhat.

"Is Marthy Ann well enough?"

"She's tolerable."

"How many children have you?"

"Three; the girls, Cynthy an' Mary—"

"I remember them."

"An' little Zeke."

'Zeki'l's face flushed.

"Named him for me, 'Lijy?"

"Yes; for you.  Cynthy's about grown now,
an' a likely girl, I can tell you."

His face softened; his eyes grew bright with
pride and tenderness as he spoke of his
children.  'Zeki'l watched him, noting the change
in his countenance, and perhaps feeling some
pain and regret that he had missed such pleasure.
'Lijy reached out his hand and laid it on his
knee.  "'Zeki'l, you must come live with us
now.  I'll tell these folks we are brothers, an'—"

"I don't know as I would," said 'Zeki'l,
gently.  "It would only make talk, an' I'm
settled here, you know."

His unimpassioned tone had its effect on his
brother.  He protested, but rather faintly,
finally saying:

"Well, if you'd rather not—"

"That's just it.  I'd rather not."

They both rose, and 'Lijy groped uncertainly
for his hat.

"Your life ain't worth much to you, 'Zeki'l,
I know it ain't," with uncontrollable emotion.

"It's worth more 'n you think, 'Lijy, more 'n
you think."

He knocked the ashes from his pipe, and
cleared his throat as though to speak again,
but his brother had reached the door before he
called to him.

"'Lijy."

"Well?"

"What became o' 'Lizabeth?"

"She's still livin' with us."

He peered into the bowl of the pipe.

"She's never married?"

"No.  She had a fall about ten years ago
which left her a cripple, an' she's grayer than
I am.  You 're not comin' to see us, 'Zeki'l?"

"I reckon not, 'Lijy."  And while 'Lijy
stumbled through the darkness home—his
errand to the store forgotten—'Zeki'l stood
before the fire, one arm resting against the black,
cobwebby mantel.  "Crippled an' gray!  O
'Lizabeth, 'Lizabeth!" he groaned, and put
his head down on his arm, the twelve years
rolling backward upon him.

"Where have you been, 'Lijy?" exclaimed
Mrs. Morgan when her husband returned.
"We waited an' waited for you, till the supper
was spoiled."

"I met a man I used to know," he said,
evasively, casting a wistful, troubled glance
toward the corner where 'Lizabeth, his wife's
sister, sat knitting, a crutch lying at her side.

Cynthia, a rosy, merry-eyed girl, laughed.

"Pa is always meetin' a man he knows."

Mrs. Morgan began hastily removing the
covered dishes from the hearth to the table.

"Well, where is the sugar you went over to
the store to get?" she demanded with some
irritation.

"I forgot it, Marthy.  I'll go for it in the
mornin'," in a confused, propitiatory tone.

She stared at him.

"I never!  Forgot what you went after!
You beat all, 'Lijy Morgan; you certainly do
beat all."

"The man must 'a' sent your wits wool-gatherin',
pa," cried Cynthia, jocosely.

'Lizabeth leaned forward.  Her face was
long, thin, and pale, and the smooth hair framing
it glinted like silver in the firelight; but
her dark eyes were wonderfully soft and
beautiful, and her mouth had chastened,
tender lines about it.

"Are you sick, 'Lijy?" she inquired, in a
gentle, subdued voice, a voice with much
underlying, patient sweetness in it.

Morgan gave her a grateful look.  "N—no;
but I don't think I care for any supper," he
said slowly.  "I'll step out an' see if the stock
has all been fed."

When he returned Mrs. Morgan sat by the
fire alone.  He looked hastily about the room.

"Where is Cynthy?"

"Gone to bed."

"An' 'Lizabeth?"

"She's off, too."

He drew a sigh of relief, and stirred the fire
into a brighter blaze.

"Marthy Ann, it was 'Zeki'l I saw this
evenin'."

She dropped the coarse garment she was
mending.

"'Zeki'l!"

"Hush!  Yes; he lives up on the hill
between here an' the store;" and then he went
on to tell her about their meeting and
conversation.  Her hard, sharp-featured face
softened a little when he came to 'Zeki'l's refusal
to live with them or to have their kinship
acknowledged.

"I'm glad to see he's got that much consideration.
We left the old place because folks
couldn't forget how he'd disgraced himself;
an' to come right where he is!  I never heard
of anything like it.  Why didn't he leave the
State if he wanted to save us more trouble?"
wiping tears of vexation from her eyes.  "You
spent nearly all you had to get him out of
prison, an' when he had to go to the penitentiary
it killed his pa an' ma, an'—"

"Be silent, woman! you don't know what
you are talkin' about!" he said sternly, writhing
in his chair like a creature in bodily pain.
"God A'mighty forgive me!"  He paused,
smote his knee with his open palm, and turned
his face away.

"Well, if I don't know what I'm talkin'
about, I'd like to know the reason!" she cried,
with the same angry excitement.  "You ain't
been like the same man you were before that
happened, you know you ain't.  I'll never be
willin' to claim kin with 'Zeki'l Morgan again,
never!  Folks may find out for themselves;
an' they'll do it soon enough—don't you be
pestered—soon enough."

But not a suspicion of the truth seemed to
occur to Zion Hill settlement.  The Morgans
were welcomed with great friendliness, and
'Zeki'l alone failed to visit them.  Children sat
around his brother's fireside, a wife ministered
to him; but he had forfeited all claim to such
homely joys.  The girls had evidently been
informed of his relationship to them, for they
looked askance at him as they passed along
the road, pity and curiosity in their eyes.  Once
he came out of the blacksmith shop, and,
meeting his sister-in-law in the roadway, stopped
her, or she would have passed with averted head.

"You needn't be so careful, Marthy Ann,"
he said, without the slightest touch of
bitterness in his calm tone.

"It is for the children's sake, 'Zeki'l," she
said, her sallow face flushing with a feeling
akin to shame.  "I must think o' them."

He gave her a strange glance, then looked
to the ground.

"I know; I thought o' them years ago."

"It's a pity you didn't think before—"

"Yes, so it is; but some deeds aren't to be
accounted for, nor recalled either, no matter
how deeply we repent."

"We sold out for the children's sake, but,
Lord!  I'm pestered now more than ever."

"Because I'm here?"

"Well, it ain't reasonable to think we can
all go right on livin' here, an' folks not find out
you an' 'Lijy are brothers."

"What would you like for me to do, Marthy Ann?"

She hesitated a moment, then drew a little
nearer to him.

"Couldn't you go away?  You've got nobody
but yourself to think about, an' I know
in reason 'Lijy would be glad to buy your
place," with a careless, half-contemptuous
glance at the cabin.

A dull flush passed over his face; his mouth
twitched.

"Does 'Lijy want me to go?"

"He ain't said so; but—"

"I'll think about it," he said slowly,
turning back to the smithy, where a red-hot tool
awaited his hammer.

But thinking about it only seemed to bind
his heart more closely than ever to the arid
spot he called home.  He had looked forward
to spending all the remaining years of his
broken, ruined life there, far from the world
and from those who had known him in the
past.  Then a great desire had risen within
him to remain near 'Lizabeth.  He shrank from
the thought of meeting her, speaking to her,
and felt rather glad that she did not appear at
church.  A few times in passing he had
caught a glimpse of her walking about the
yard or garden in the winter sunshine, leaning
on her crutch, and the sight had sent him on
his way with downcast face.  He had just sat
down before the fire to smoke one evening
when there came a timid knock on the door.
It was just between daylight and darkness, and
he supposed it to be some neighbor on his way
to or from the store who wished to drop in to
warm himself and gossip a little.

"Come in," he said hospitably, and, reaching
out, drew the other chair nearer the fire.

The latch was slowly lifted, the door swung
open, and then he started to his feet, pipe and
tobacco falling to the floor, while his face
flushed and paled, and his breath came in a
sharp sigh.  It was 'Lizabeth, her bonnet
pushed back, her shawl hanging loosely
around her shoulders.

"I've be'n to the store for Marthy Ann,
I wanted to go to get out away from the
house a little while, and I thought I'd step in
for a minute, 'Zeki'l, to see you."

"You are tired; come an' sit down," he said
huskily, and led her to the chair.

   "DO YOU THINK YOUR LAMENESS WOULD MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE?"

What emotion those simple, commonplace
words covered!  They looked at each other,
silently noting the changes time and sorrow
had wrought.  They had never been openly
declared lovers, but words were not needed
for them to understand each other, and they
knew that they would marry when she had
finished her term as teacher in the county
school, and he had built a house on the lot of
land his father had given him.  But that
shameful, undenied accusation of horse-stealing,
followed swiftly by trial and conviction,
had put an end to all hopes, all plans.

"You see I'm a cripple now, 'Zeki'l," she
said, to break the silence.

"An' I've grown old," he replied, and their
eyes met again in a long, eloquent, steadfast
gaze, and they knew that neither age, nor
affliction, nor shame, nor separation had wrought
any change in their love.  It had only grown
stronger and deeper.  Her thin face flushed,
her trembling fingers gathered up a fold of her
gown.

"Why don't you come to see us, 'Zeki'l?"

"I can't, 'Lizabeth; I can't.  It wouldn't
be right.  Don't you know I've been longin' to
come, an' hungerin' an' hungerin' to see you?"  He
flung himself on the floor at her feet, his
face hidden against her knees.  "You don't
know all! you don't know all!"  The words
were wrung from him by an almost uncontrollable
desire to tell her the story of his sufferings.
She had not turned against him nor forgotten
him.  It was almost more than he could
bear, to read in her eyes her faith and her
pardon.  He felt the touch of her hand on his
bared head, and tears gushed from his eyes.

"Can't you tell me?" she whispered, her
face, her eyes, illumined by a pity and
tenderness divine in their beauty.

"No, honey; it's somethin' I must bear alone,
I must bear alone."

He rose to his feet again, brushing his sleeve
across his eyes, and she stood up also, leaning
on her crutch, the transient glow of color
fading from her face.

"You shouldn't bear it alone if I didn't
have this lameness.  You—"

"Hush!" he said, and, taking her hand,
pressed it against his breast.  "Do you think
your lameness would make any difference?
Wouldn't I love you all the more, take care o'
you all the better, for it?  It's the disgrace,
the shame, standin' between us.  I'll never
outlive it—get rid of it—an' I'll never ask any
woman to share it.  I couldn't."

Her physical infirmity held her silent.  She
would be a care and a burden to him rather
than a help.  She drew up her shawl.

"The Almighty comfort you, 'Zeki'l."

"An' take care o' you, 'Lizabeth."

He took her hand in a grasp painful in its
closeness, then he turned and leaned against
the mantel, and she went softly out of the
room.


Winter passed.  The frost-bound earth
sent up faint scents and sounds of spring in
fresh-plowed fields and swelling buds.  'Zeki'l
wandered about his fields in idleness, striving
to make up his mind to go away.  It would be
best, yet the sacrifice seemed cruel.

"It is more than I can bear," he cried aloud
one night, and strained one of the violin-strings
until it snapped asunder.  He laid the
instrument across his knees and leaned his
head upon it.  The candle burned dimly, and
a bat flew in through the open door, circled
around the room, at last extinguishing the
feeble light with one of its outspread wings.
But the unhappy man did not heed the
gloom.  Why should he care to have a light
for his eyes when his soul was in such
darkness?  He groped his way to the bed, and
fell down upon it.  Rover came back from
a nightly prowl, barked to let his master
know of his presence, then lay down on the
doorstep.

The sound of music vibrated through the
air, and 'Zeki'l remembered that the young
people of the settlement were to have a
"singing" at his brother's that evening.  He raised
his head and listened.  They were singing
hymns, and many of them were associated with
recollections of his own youth.  A line of Tom
Moore's "Come, ye disconsolate," once a
special favorite when sorrow seemed far from him,
was borne to his ears:

   |  Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.
   |

He lay down and slept.

At dusk the next evening, as he was heating
a piece of iron in the blacksmith shop, a man
stopped at the wide-open door.

"Will you give me a night's lodging?  I
have walked far to-day, and I'm a stranger in
this part of the country."

'Zeki'l wheeled, the light from the forge
shining across his face.  It brought out the
stranger's face and form in bold relief also.
"Why, it's Zeke Morgan!" he cried, walking
into the shop.

"Yes: I thought I recognized your voice,
Miller," said 'Zeki'l, slowly, and without much
pleasure at the recognition.

They had been in prison together, and
'Zeki'l had left Miller there.  He had never
felt any liking for the man, and less now than
ever, as he looked at his ragged clothing and
dissipated face.  He had evidently been
steadily sinking in vice, and its repulsiveness was
impressed upon his outward being.  But a
certain pity stirred 'Zeki'l's heart.  He
remembered his own friendlessness when he entered
that settlement.  Could he show less mercy
than had been shown to him?

"Sit down, won't you?" he said kindly, blowing
up the coals in the forge to a glowing heat.

"That I will.  I'm footsore, and hungry as
a bear.  I'm in luck to meet with you,
comrade," chuckling.

'Zeki'l winced.  The man's familiarity grated
upon him.

"Where are you goin'?" he inquired.

"Oh, nowhere in particular.  I'm jest out."

"Why, I thought your time would be up in
two years after I left."

Miller shrugged his shoulders.  "Yes; but
I made so many attempts to escape that they
kept adding extra time to my term."

He sat down while 'Zeki'l finished his work.

"You seem to be getting on pretty well,"
he continued, his restless eyes scanning the
surroundings.

"Only tolerable."

Two or three of the neighbors dropped in,
one to leave a broken plow, another to tell a
bit of gossip.  They stared curiously at 'Zeki'l's
disreputable companion, who jocosely
informed them that Morgan had once been his
chum.

'Zeki'l felt annoyed, and, closing up the
shop, invited his guest into the house.  They
had supper, then sat down and smoked.  Miller
talked a good deal, and asked many questions
about the neighborhood and the store; but at
last he fell asleep, huddled up on the bed, and
'Zeki'l lay down on a bench, recollections of
his prison life keeping him awake far into the
night.  When he awoke the next morning his
guest was gone.  He was glad of it.  The
man's presence oppressed him—brought a sense
of degradation.  But what were his feelings when
he heard that Mr. Davy Tanner's store had been
robbed, the mail-box rifled, letters torn open,
and various articles of wearing apparel taken!

He grew so pale, seemed so agitated and
confused, that the man who had come up to
tell the news stared wonderingly, half-suspiciously
at him.  He had brought the plow to
the shop the evening before, and he now
looked around for the stranger.

"Where is your friend?" he inquired.

"He is no friend of mine."

"But he 'lowed that he knew you."

"Yes."

"Where?"

"In prison," said 'Zeki'l, quietly, though he
flushed with shame.

"Aha!  I lowed so, I jest 'lowed so, last night."

'Zeki'l tingled all over.  He had never felt
the degradation of being a convict more keenly
than at that moment.  He suspected Miller of
the theft: this man's tone implied that he
suspected them both.  It showed how slight a
hold he had upon the trust of his neighbors if
they could so readily believe that he would
rob the best friend he had in the settlement.
He went into the house, and sat down by the
hearth, his head leaned between his hands.

News of the robbery spread, and men left
their work to go over to the store—stirred up,
pleasantly excited.  It was not often that Zion
Hill settlement could boast of having anything
so important as this robbery take place within
its limits, and it must be made the most of.

'Zeki'l held aloof from the store, where he
knew a large crowd had collected, but later in
the day a small delegation came up to
interview him.  He read suspicion in every face,
indignation in every eye.  His quiet, honest
life among them had been forgotten; they
remembered only that he had been a convict.

"Once a thief, always a thief, I say!" one
man cried loudly.

'Zeki'l clenched his hands, but what could he
say in self-defense?  He made a clear,
straight-forward statement of all he knew about Miller,
earnestly denying all knowledge of the robbery,
but he felt the slight impression it made
on their doubting minds.  They did not
openly accuse him, but they asked many questions,
they exchanged knowing glances, and when
they went away he felt that he had been tried
and condemned.  The sheriff had gone in
pursuit of Miller, and all day groups of men sat
or stood about the store whittling sticks,
chewing tobacco, and talking.  It was a most
enjoyable day to them.  It afforded excitement,
and gave an opportunity to air opinions—to
bring forth old prejudices.  There was almost
universal condemnation of 'Zeki'l.  He had
entertained the thief, had given him all the
information necessary, and the more bitter ones
wagged their heads and said that no doubt
he had shared in the spoils.  Even Mr. Davy
Tanner looked sad and doubtful, though he
defended the unfortunate man.

"We've no right ever to accuse a person
without evidence o' guilt.  We don't know
even that this other man had anything to do
with it—though circumstances do all p'int that
way—let alone 'Zeki'l Morgan.  It's best to
hold our peace till we find out the truth."

"But it looks mighty suspicious ag'in' 'Zeki'l."

"Because he's been in the penitentiary, an'
we think he's got a bad name by it."

"Well, ain't that enough to set honest men
ag'in' him?"

"Yes; but it ain't best to always judge a
man by his misdeeds in the past, but rather by
his good deeds in the present, an' what they
promise for the future."

"Why not, when it's accordin' to scriptur'?"

So the talk went on, while 'Zeki'l sat by his
fireless hearth or walked aimlessly up and
down the yard.  At dusk his brother called,
looking almost as haggard as he did.

"It's a bad thing, 'Zeki'l."

"Yes," said 'Zeki'l, listlessly.

"They are fools to think you had anything
to do with it, plumb fools."

"It's natural they should, 'Lijy."

"I can't stand it, 'Zeki'l!  Lord!  I can't
stand it!"

He fell into a chair and covered his face with
his hands.

"Chut, man! what does it matter?" said
'Zeki'l, bracing himself up and forcing a smile.
"Don't let 'Lizabeth believe it, that's all I ask."

"She'll never believe it."

"It's all right, then; I'll not care what the
rest o' the world thinks."

"But I do," cried 'Lijy, starting up, "an' I'll
put an end to it by—"

"You'll not do anything rash, 'Lijy," said
'Zeki'l, firmly, quietly, and laid his hand on
the other's shoulder.  "Recollect your family."

He looked slight and insignificant by the
side of his brother, but his face had a strength
and calmness which seemed to give it a power
the other lacked.  'Lijy groaned, and turned
tremblingly away.

A week passed, but Zion Hill settlement
could not go back to its every-day vocations
until somebody had been arrested for the
robbery.  The man Miller seemed to be wary
prey, eluding his pursuers with the crafty skill
of an old offender.  It was a solitary week to
'Zeki'l.  He had been completely ostracized
by his neighbors.  They openly shunned him,
and no more work came to his forge.  He stood
in the empty shop one day, wondering what he
should do next, where he should go, when
'Lizabeth walked slowly, quietly in.

He flushed painfully.

"You see I'm idle," he said, pointing to the
dead coals in the forge.  "They don't think
I'm worthy o' doin' their work any longer."

"I wouldn't mind," she said, tenderly,
laying her hand on his arm.  "They'll see they
are mistaken after a while, and be glad enough
to come back to you."

   :alt: "THE SHERIFF, TWO DEPUTIES, AND MILLER.

   "THE SHERIFF, TWO DEPUTIES, AND MILLER."

"I don't know," with a heavy sigh.  "It's
the injustice that hurts me, an' the lack o' faith
in my honesty.  The years I've lived here
count for nothin' with them."

"I have faith in you, 'Zeki'l."

He laid his hand over hers.

"If I had you, 'Lizabeth, if I only had you
to help me bear it!"

"That's what I've come for, 'Zeki'l.  I'm
crippled.  It may be that I'll turn out to be
more of a burden than a comfort to you, but
I can't sit down there any longer, knowin' you
are here slighted and sufferin' all alone.
'Zeki'l, have pity on me, if you've none on
yourself, and let me bear this trouble with
you."

He trembled before the future her words
conjured up.

"Could you, would you, be willin' to bear
my disgrace, share it, be shunned like a plague,
have no company, no friend, but me?"

"What are friends to the one we love, or
company?  I'd give up all the world, 'Zeki'l,
willin'ly, willin'ly, for you."

He looked into her deep, earnest eyes, realized
the full truth of her words, and drew her
closer to him.

"It's a great sacrifice, 'Lizabeth, an' I'm
wrong to let you make it; but—the Lord
forgive me!  I can't hold out alone any longer.
My will an' my courage are all broke down.
I need help; I need you."

After a momentary silence he dusted a
bench, and they sat down to talk over their
plans for the future.  The shop, black with
charcoal and iron dust, was a queer place for
such a conversation; but they paid little heed
to their surroundings.

"Marthy Ann will never get over your
marryin' me," said 'Zeki'l.

"Then she can make the best of it."

The next day was Saturday, and the
beginning of the regular monthly "meetin'" at
Zion Hill church.  Everybody in the settlement
who could, attended services that day.
The Morgans were all there, even 'Lizabeth,
and 'Zeki'l sat in his accustomed place,
apparently unmindful of the cold, hostile glances
and whispers around him.  Through open
doors and windows shone golden sunlight,
floated spicy odors from the woods
surrounding all but the front of the church, which faced
the public road; and vagrant bees mingled
their lazy hum with the champing of bits and
the stamping of iron-shod hoofs in the thickets,
where the mules and the horses were tied.

It was a quiet but alert congregation.  A
kind of expectancy—of suspense—filled the air.
No telling what might happen before the day
was over.  The preacher made the robbery
the theme of his discourse, and there were
nods and approving looks when he referred to
the punishment laid up for those who persisted
in doing evil.  It was a fitting finale that just
before the benediction was pronounced a small
cavalcade rode up to the church door—the
sheriff, two deputies, and Miller.  A thrill ran
through the church, a rustle, a whisper, and
the preacher cried aloud to the sheriff:

"What do you want, Brother Mangum?"

"'Zeki'l Morgan."

"Here he is! here he is!" cried more than
one voice, and men rose to their feet and laid
eager hands on the unresisting 'Zeki'l.

"What do you want him for?" cried 'Lijy
Morgan, rising from his seat in the deacons'
corner.  "What's he done?"

"Helped to rob the store."

"We've said so, we've said so, ever since
it happened!" a chorus of stern but triumphant
voices exclaimed.

"Bring up the witness ag'in' him, the man
that says he did it," said 'Lijy, advancing to
the open space before the pulpit.

"No man has said out an' out that he helped
to do it, but Miller—"

"It's a lie," cried 'Lijy, loud enough to be
heard beyond the church door.

'Zeki'l's eyes were fixed anxiously, warningly,
on his brother, and once he tried to throw
off the hands holding him.

"Prove it, then!" a taunting voice cried out.

"I will," said 'Lijy, though he grew pale,
and trembled strangely.  "A more honest man
than 'Zeki'l Morgan never lived."

"What do you know of him?"

Again 'Zeki'l strove to free himself, but
failed.

"'Lijy!" he called imploringly, "'Lijy, 'Lijy,
mind what you say!"

'Lijy looked across at him.

"I will mind the truth, 'Zeki'l."  He turned
to the congregation.

"I come here with good recommendations,
brethren; I am a deacon o' the church; you
have faith in my integrity, my honor."  An
approving murmur went up.  "If a dozen thieves
were to stop at my house there'd be no
suspicion against me."  He paused, passed his
hand over his face, then looked up again.
"Years ago there were two brothers in this
State who grew up together happy and
contented.  The elder one was always a little
wild, and would get drunk sometimes, even
after he'd married and had a family to look
after, but the younger was the steadiest, best
boy in the settlement.  One night the elder
brother, in a fit of drunken recklessness, stole
a horse from the camp of a Kentucky drover,
an' nobody found it out but his brother, who
undertook to return the horse, an' was arrested.
He took the guilt, he stood the trial, an' went
to the penitentiary.  He lost his good name,
the girl he loved, his home, everything in the
world an honest man values.  He served his
time, an' instead o' comin' home to be a
reproach to his cowardly brother, he, when free,
went away into a strange settlement to live.
An' by an' by his brother moved there too, an'
his conscience hurt him more an' more as he
saw what a sad, lonesome life the convict lived.
He was prosperous, he enjoyed the confidence
of his fellow-men, while the other was shunned,
and regarded with distrust."  Emotion checked
his utterance for a moment; then he turned
and pointed to 'Zeki'l.  "Brethren, look at that
man; look without prejudice or suspicion, an'
you'll not see guilt in his face nor on his
conscience.  There never lived a truer hero than
'Zeki'l Morgan.  Nobody should know it better
than I, for I am the brother whose crime he
suffered for."

Then he walked across the floor to 'Zeki'l's
side in the midst of the deepest silence which
had ever fallen upon a congregation in Zion
Hill church.

The Capelles were Louisianians, of French
descent, and before the war lived in New
Orleans, occasionally visiting their plantations
on Red River.  But Anthony Capelle was
killed in the battle of Vicksburg, and after the
surrender Mrs. Anthony Capelle sold the Red
River plantations for about half their value,
placed her New Orleans property in the hands
of a lawyer, gathered up some of her household
stuffs, books, and other things she prized,
and with her little daughter Madeline, and one
old negro who had spent his life in the service
of the Capelles, removed to Marietta, Georgia.
Those were days of change and great confusion,
and she disappeared from New Orleans
and the knowledge of old friends without
calling forth comment or question, and she was
received into the social life of Marietta in the
same way.  It was not the time to sit in
judgment on one's neighbors—to probe for secret
motives or purposes.  A common woe made
all akin.  From a merchant and planter who
wished to sell out and go west to recuperate
his broken fortunes, Agnese Capelle bought a
house and lot on the northeast side of the
town, and with her small family settled
quietly down.  It was a picturesque old house,
built after the colonial fashion, and set back
from the street in the seclusion of an oak grove.
In the early spring the graveled walks were
bordered with jonquils and mountain pink, and
from April to December the roses bloomed
along the garden fence and around the piazza.

The tumult following the war died away.
People ceased to go about with a helpless,
bewildered look as they learned to adjust
themselves to the new conditions of life, and
realized that the negro could no longer be regarded
as a slave, but as a free citizen, with all the
rights and privileges of citizenship.  The laws
of the country made white and black equal,
but there was some bitter triumph in the
consciousness that unwritten social laws would
hold them forever apart, two distinct races, one
degraded by color and past servitude.  On the
surface of life the agitations and thrills of the
strong undercurrents ceased to make much
impression; they had sunk too deep.  The
country at large settled to outward peace, and
from politics and social questions attention
turned to commerce and manufacture, to the
development of rich mineral resources, and to
literature.  But the years passed quietly
enough over the Capelles.  They were so
strongly fixed in their pride and prejudices
against social equality that they pursued their
own gentle, even way, untouched by the
convulsions and throes of fierce indignation around
them.  Their servants were treated with kindness
and consideration, and when the old man
who had clung to them with unbroken faith
through slavery and freedom died, they wept
over him, and felt that a noble friend had been
lost, though also a negro and a servant.  And
Madeline developed into womanhood, beginning
her education at her mother's knee, and
finishing it at a college in Virginia.

She was gifted above the average girl in wit
and beauty, and possessed not only fascinating,
lovely manners, but the tenderest heart and the
finest sympathies.  She was a girl of ardent
temperament, but refined and delicate in all
her tastes, and pure in thought and aspiration.
She had strong convictions and opinions of her
own, read and reflected more than the ordinary
Southern girl, and loved music passionately.
The simplest strain could make her eyes
kindle, her color come and go, in a sort of
silent rapture, and the pathos of a negro song
moved her heart deeply.  In person she was
slightly above medium height, and held her
head with an imperial grace not at all unsuitable
to her youth and her French ancestry.  Her
hair was burnished brown, with a crisp wave in
it, her eyes blue-gray and brilliant.  But she
lacked the clear, thin, transparent skin usually
accompanying such hair and eyes, the blood
pulsing through it pink as a rose.  Hers was
soft as velvet, with an opaque creamy tint, and
the faintest suggestion of color, ordinarily.
She had scores of friends, and in her own
small family circle was looked upon as the
most beautiful and lovable girl in the world.
In Agnese Capelle's love for this fair daughter
there was a passionate protective tenderness, a
subtle quality one would have called pity, had
not such a thing seemed absurd in connection
with Madeline.  While not betraying any
undue anxiety over her marriage and settlement
in life, she studied each suitor that appeared on
the scene, and if eligible, gave him a gracious
welcome.  But Madeline's heart remained in
her own possession until she met Roger
Everett.

Marietta was just attracting the attention of
the Northern invalid and also the Northern
capitalist.  A few delicate, weak-lunged
people had found their way to it, and a company
of enterprising men had projected a railroad to
pass through the north Georgia mountains,
across the Blue Ridge, and into North Carolina
and Tennessee.  Along the line of this road
marble quarries were being opened and gold
and talc mines discovered; but Marietta still
preserved its provincial ways and appearances,
its best houses the old colonial mansions, its
churches overgrown with ivy, Cherokee-rose
hedges bounding the pastures and gardens on
the outskirts of the town, and inclosing the
neglected-looking graveyard.  Its picturesque
hills were overshadowed by Kennesaw Mountain,
with the solitary peak of Lost Mountain
rising far to the south, and the dim, broken
outline of the Blue Ridge range bounding the
northern horizon.  The hills and the mountains
are still there, but the town has caught the
spirit of progress sweeping with electrical
effect over the South.  Handsome modern
residences are springing up, hotels and boarding-houses
are being opened, and on the northeast
side of the town a beautiful national cemetery
has been laid out, where the Union soldiers
who fell in the battles around Atlanta lie
buried.  The public square is still the scene of
lively traffic in the fall, when the streets are
crowded with wagons heavily loaded with
cotton, the farmers, white and black, standing
around, clothed in jeans and homespun, while
the buyers go about thrusting sampling-hooks
into the great bales to test the quality of the
cotton and to determine its market value.
But these brown, tobacco-chewing countrymen
jostle the New Yorker, the Bostonian, and,
indeed, people from all parts of the Union,
seeking health and fortune.

Roger Everett was one of the first New England
men to find his way to Marietta, and to
invest in the Pickens County Marble Works.  He
belonged to *the* Everetts of Massachusetts, a
family of strong abolitionists, and possessed his
share of the traditional New England reserve
and the deeply rooted New England pride.
For a year or two he devoted himself almost
exclusively to business, making only occasional
visits to Marietta; but his circle of acquaintances
widened, and, being young and
handsome and cultivated, he was at last drawn into
the social life of the town, and few parties or
picnics were complete without him.  He and
Madeline met at one of the picnics, danced
together once at one of the parties, but their
acquaintance really began the day a large
party went up the new railroad to the marble
works.  It fell to Everett to play the part of
cicerone, and though Madeline shrieked less
and asked fewer questions than the other girls,
there was an intelligent comprehension in her
eyes when he explained the process of getting
out the marble from the quarries, and the
machinery used for cutting it into blocks, that
made him feel that he was talking directly to
her.  They lunched on the bank of Long
Swamp Creek, with the purple shadows of the
mountains falling over them, and mountain
laurel in bloom all about them.  Then
Madeline and the young Northerner strolled away
down the stream to look for maidenhair ferns.
They talked at first on general topics, and then
the girl asked some questions about the North,
drawing in her breath with little quivering
sighs as he told her of frozen rivers, of snows
so deep one could scarcely walk through them,
of sleighing and skating.

"And—and is it true what they say about
the negroes?" she questioned hesitatingly,
curious to hear with her own ears the opinion
of one of these rabid abolitionists—at least she
had read in the papers that they were rabid.

He smiled, broke off a bit of laurel, pink and
fragrant, and offered it to her.

"What do they say, Miss Capelle?"

"That they are equal—that we should
recognize them.  Oh, I hardly know how to
explain it," breaking off with a little laugh, not
caring to tread too boldly on delicate ground
for fear he should feel wounded.

"We respect them where they deserve it,
just as we do all men," he said calmly.

"Regardless of color?"

"Yes.  What has the color of a man's skin
to do with the question of his worth?"

"Everything, if he is a negro.  Could
you—I beg your pardon for asking the question—sit
at the table with a *negro?* actually break bread
with him as your equal?"

"If he were a gentleman, yes," firmly, his
blue eyes meeting hers fearlessly.

"Oh, oh! how could you?  I cannot understand
it.  I am fond of some negroes.  I loved
Uncle Sam, I like Aunt Dilsey, and I'm sorry
for them as a race, but meet them on common
ground I could not."  And then they drifted
away from the dangerous topic.

He walked with her and her mother to the
train that evening, and Mrs. Capelle invited
him warmly and graciously to call upon them
when he came to Marietta again.

"He is interesting," she said to Madeline,
with a backward glance through the car window
at his tall, slight figure as the train swept
them away from the station.

"Do you think so, *chérie* mama?" indifferently,
*her* eyes looking down upon her lap.

"He is handsome and well-bred."

"Oh, he is a Yankee," maliciously.

"He is a gentleman."

And then they looked at each other and
laughed gently, and Madeline held up a little
paper-weight of pale pink marble, veined with
threads of white, that he had selected and
ordered polished for her as a souvenir of the
day.

From that day it was a clear case of strong
mutual attraction.  What though they had
been differently trained, and their opinions
clashed on some points?  They came out of
wordy controversies firmer friends than ever.
There was never-ending interest in their
combats, and the lightest jest or banter held a
fascination keen as the brightest wit.  He
called Madeline a narrow-minded, illiberal
provincial, for holding such fierce prejudices
against the colored people, and she retorted
that the negro had become a sentiment to the
North, and that if they, the Yankees, would
give some of their attention and pity to the
poor white people crowding their large cities,
the South would solve its own great problem.
Sometimes they parted in anger; but it was
short-lived, for love drew them with irresistible
force, and if they disagreed on a few questions,
how many hopes, thoughts, and desires
they had in common! what taste and sympathy!

Mrs. Capelle looked on, sighed, and smiled,
but waited in silence for Madeline's confidence.
And one evening she came in, knelt at her
mother's feet, put her arms around her, and
pressed her flushed, tremulous, radiant face
against her bosom.  Mrs. Capelle flushed and
trembled herself, and gathered that proud
young head closer to her heart.

"You have promised to marry him," she said
in a whisper.

"He asked me again this evening.  I could
not put him off," Madeline confessed, also in a
whisper.

"Coquette!  Did you want to put him off?"

"N—no."

"Oh, oh! he is a Yankee."

"I love him."

"He may take you away to his hard, his
cold New England."

"We are to live here with you."

"Without consulting me?  Fie! what
aggressive children!"

"You are glad, mama.  Why are you so
glad I'm to be married?"

"I am longing to see you safe, my darling,"
dropping her teasing tone, and speaking with
sudden agitation.

"Am I not safe with you?" lifting her head,
and looking tenderly into the delicate face
above her.

"But I am not strong, sweet, and I may be
called suddenly from you some day, and it is
not good for girls to be alone.  It will be
comforting to leave you in such hands.  He is
noble, he is good, and will love you faithfully.
Ah, Madeline, he is strong and firm; he will
rule my wilful girl."

"I should not love him if I could rule him,"
said Madeline, proudly.

Mrs. Capelle laughed and kissed her.  "Tell
me all about it," she said softly.  They talked
until the hand of the clock pointed to twelve,
and only the barking of a dog or two pierced
the silence resting upon the town.

"We have no secrets—no secrets from each
other, have we, mama?" said Madeline with a
happy laugh.

"No secrets, sweet?  No, no; there should
be no secrets between mother and child," said
the elder woman; but her eyes fell; a paleness
swept over her face.  It was a swift, subtle
change, unnoticed by the girl in the delicious
absorption of her thoughts.

That was a winter to live in the memory of
those lovers as long as they lived.  Every one
of the swiftly flying days seemed to have its
own special joy, its own sweet experiences.
When apart, there were long letters written
out of the fullness of their hearts; when
together, long talks, or delicious silences in
which it seemed enough that they could be
together.

And there were letters from his New
England home to her, one from his mother, as
sweet and gentle as her own mother could have
written.

"She must be lovely, Roger," she said to him.

"She is," he replied with proud loyalty.  "I
am longing for you to see her."

"I shrink from it, for if she should not be
pleased with me—"

"She must; she cannot help it, dearest.  Ah! you
know that you'll charm her," putting his
hand under her chin, and turning her face
upward to his eyes, its palpitant color, proud, shy
eyes, and lovely tremulousness, a tacit
confession of his power.

Before she could elude him—for with all
her caressing ways and Southern temperament,
lending itself so naturally to demonstrativeness,
she was very chary of her favors—he
drew her into his arms against his heart, and
kissed her.

Mrs. Capelle spent those winter days sewing
on fine linen, cambric, sheer muslin, and lace,
stitching many loving thoughts into the dainty
garments intended for Madeline's wardrobe.
Imperceptibly, as it were, she had grown very
fragile, and the least excitement caused her to
palpitate and tremble, with flushed face and
hand pressed upon her heart.

She had been a devout Catholic in her youth,
and though removed from her church, she still
occasionally attended mass in Atlanta, and
went to confession.  But as the winter passed,
her thoughts turned longingly to Father Vincent,
her old father confessor, and one day in
the early spring she received a letter from him.
He would in a short time pass through
Marietta on his way to the North.  Could he stop
for a day with them?  It seemed such a direct
answer to her secret desire for his counsel that
she joyfully hastened to reply, telling him how
she needed his advice and his blessing.

She had rejoiced over Madeline's engagement,
but as the time set for her marriage drew
near, some secret trouble seemed to wear upon
her, much to the girl's distress.

"What is it, mama?" she asked, sitting at
her feet, and taking her hand and laying it
against her cheek.

"What can it be but the loss of you, sweet?"
she replied quickly.  "You must allow me to
be jealous and foolish."

"But you are not going to lose me, dearest
mama, and are you sure—I have fancied there
must be something else troubling you."

"Indeed you must not think so; I am selfish
to—"

"Selfish!  You, the best and sweetest
woman in the world, selfish!  I'll not believe
that."  Still she did not feel satisfied, and was
greatly relieved when Father Vincent came,
and she saw her mother brighten and look like
her old self.  It was about two weeks before
the wedding that he came, and was persuaded
to stop with them two days instead of one.
He was an old man, small, slender, and ascetic
looking, with clear, calm eyes, and a sweet
voice.

It was the afternoon of his arrival that
Madeline went out to make some calls, but after
one visit changed her mind, and returned
home.  She did not at once go to her mother,
knowing that she and Father Vincent would
probably have much to say to each other, but
turned into the parlor, cool, dusky, and
deserted, and went to the little alcove, where she
had left her embroidery and the last letter from
her lover.  It was simply a corner of the big
room, furnished with a lounge and a small
table, and shut in by soft silk curtains.  How
long she had been there, re-reading that letter,
dreaming over her work, she could not tell,
when roused by footsteps and voices in the
room—her mother and the priest.

"You hinted at some special cause for trouble
in your letter," he said, as they sat down in
close proximity to those curtains and
Madeline's retreat.

"Yes; it concerns Madeline."

"What of her?  I thought her future had
been settled.  Is she not to be married in a
short time?"

"Yes; but, Father, she is not my child, and
I am growing doubtful of the honor of my
course in regard to this marriage."

"Not your child!" exclaimed Father Vincent
in surprise, for he thought that he knew
all the Capelle secrets.

"No.  I would to God that she were!"
she said with deep emotion, "for I love
her so well that I'd gladly give my life to
know that pure, unmixed blood flowed in her
veins."

His chair creaked as he drew it a little nearer
her; his voice sank to a low key:

"You do not mean—"

"Yes; her mother was a quadroon," in a
trembling whisper.

Did he hear that strange gasping sigh, as of
a dumb creature struck by a mortal blow, that
he so quickly and abruptly exclaimed:

"Where is she now?"

"Out calling.  I did not dare speak of this
while she was in the house, for fear the very
walls would betray the secret.  She must never
know it, never!  It would ruin her life, kill her,
my poor, proud child!"

Her voice broke in tears.

"Tell me the whole story," said the priest
gently, but with authority.

"Yes, yes; that is what I am longing to do.
The secret has become a burden to me: I want
to be assured that I have acted rightly about
her marriage.  You remember my husband's
brother, Lawrence Capelle?"

"Well, very well; a handsome young fellow,
but rather wild."

"And lovable with it all.  He died while my
husband and I were in France—we were there
three years—and before his death he wrote to
Anthony, begging him to look after the welfare
of a child, a baby, and giving the history of
his attachment to a beautiful quadroon in New
Orleans.  Her mother had been a slave, but this
girl had been born free, received a very good
education, and grew up superior to her class.
She had loved him with rare faith and tenderness,
and died at the birth of the child."

"They were not married, of course?"

"Married?  Oh, no; but he had really been
quite fond of her, and he dwelt at length upon
the beauty and intelligence of the child.  We
came home very quietly, and before going to
our own house, or betraying our presence to
even intimate friends, we sought her out, and
the moment I took her in my arms, looked
into her eyes—Lawrence's own beautiful gray
eyes, smiling with innocent fearlessness
straight into my own—my heart went out to
her in such a gush of love, pity, tenderness, I
did not feel that I could ever be parted from
her.  Father, she was the loveliest, most
lovable child I ever saw.  We adopted her, we
made her our very own, and no one knew that
she had not really been born to us abroad.
Not even to you, Father, did we confess the
truth.  The war came then, and Anthony died
at Vicksburg; but I could not feel utterly alone,
utterly bereft, while I had Madeline.  I made
plans for her; I said that she should never
know that she was not truly my own child.
Her training, her education, became the
absorbing interest of my life.  After the close of
the war I thought it best for her sake to leave
New Orleans, to seek a new and more obscure
home, away from old friends, old ties.  If we
remained there she might in some way learn
the truth.  We came here, you and my lawyer
alone knowing where to find us.  I have
brought her up most carefully.  She is refined,
beautiful, accomplished, and innocent as a
young girl should be, but you can see for
yourself what she is.  I instilled the strongest race
prejudices into her mind.  I impressed it upon
her that the negro is an inferior creature, a
servant of servants, to be treated with
kindness, but never to be considered an equal; for
a morbid fear that her mother's blood would
betray itself in some coarse or degraded taste,
haunted me.  But I am no longer afraid for
her.  Have I acted with wisdom?  Have I
done well to lift her up?"

"Assuredly; only"—he reflected a moment—"only
your extreme course in regard to
color prejudice would make the truth a
hundredfold harder to bear should she discover it."

"But she shall not discover it.  In two
weeks she will be married to this young
Northerner, her life merged into his, her very
name lost.  Is it right, is it cheating him?"

"If you cannot tell her, then you must not
tell him, for it would only be to raise a barrier
of secrecy between them."

"Tell me there is no dishonesty, no sin in
it, and my heart will be at rest."

"According to my understanding, Agnese
Capelle, there is none, but the highest human
understanding is at best but poor authority.
You have rescued this child from the common
fate of her class, elevated her, thrown around
her love, protection, the honor of a good name.
You save her from the consequences of her
father's sin.  Be contented with your work.
For marriage will be the crowning of it, and if
she is noble, neither origin nor birth can make
her less precious to her husband.  I only wish
there were more women like you in this country."

She drew a long breath of relief, but humbly
said:

"Do not credit me with being a humanitarian.
It was simply for love of her I did it all, and
lately I have craved your blessing on it, Father
Vincent, for I have developed the heart-disease
hereditary in my family, and look any
hour to be called hence."

A little longer they talked, and then went
away, Mrs. Capelle to seek some repose after
the excitement of the interview, and the priest
to stroll about the grounds in prayer or meditation.

When the last sound of their footsteps and
voices died away, the curtains were drawn
aside, and Madeline came out of her retreat.
She looked wan and ghastly, and groped her
way across the room and up to her own
apartment as though stricken with sudden blindness.

She closed and locked the door, then flung
herself prone upon the floor.  She felt like
writhing and screaming aloud instead of lying
there like a senseless log, only her tongue
seemed paralyzed, her body numbed.  And
yet she could think—think with burning,
agonizing intensity.  Could it be true, or only
a hideous nightmare out of which she would
presently wake?  Her mother a quadroon, her
grandmother a slave!  She wondered that the
very thought of it did not kill her.  Her name,
her pride, everything that she had cherished,
had been torn from her, and she—she had been
hurled down into a black abyss where she
must grovel and suffer until death set her free.
Strange visions seemed to come before her out
of the remote past—visions of African jungles,
of black, half-naked savages borne across the
seas to be bought and sold, to pine and fret
in bondage, longing for the freedom which
never came to them.

They were her ancestors; their blood,
degraded by generations of slavery, flowed in her
veins.  Her education, her refinement, her
prejudices would only be instruments of torture
now, with that secret consciousness of shame
and degradation underlying them.  It was as
cruel, as complete, as if it had been planned
with Machiavellian art to this ending; and
through the confused misery of her thoughts
ran a sensation of pity for her mother, that she
had so unconsciously spoiled her work.  Presently
the stunned feeling passed, and she rose
to her feet again, and walked about the room.
On the bed and chairs were strewed the pretty
things belonging to her wedding outfit.  Half
unconsciously she folded and put them away.
She would not need them now.  Once she went
to the mirror, and, leaning close to it, looked
at herself, seeking for traces of that race she
had been taught to regard as the lowest on
earth.  Did that soft fullness of lip, that crisp
wave in her hair, that velvety, opaque skin
come from her mother?  A momentary savage
rage thrilled her.  She struck the glass so
fierce a blow with her closed hand that it
cracked from bottom to top.  Then her eyes
fell on her lover's picture, placed in an open
velvet frame, and she paled and shuddered.
She did not touch it, though a hundred times
it had been pressed to heart and lip, but gazed
at it with that intense parting look we give the
dead before they are hidden forever from us;
then she leaned over the bureau, her head
bowed upon her folded arms.

The afternoon passed; twilight crept into
the room.  Faint sounds of life came up from
the lower part of the house; the tea-bell rang;
at last some one came slowly, heavily up the
stairs, shuffled across the hall, and knocked
on her door.

"Miss Mad'line, Miss Mad'line."  She opened
the door, and found Aunt Dilsey standing
there, a big, coffee-colored mulatto woman,
panting from the exertion of mounting the
stairs, the wrinkles in her fat neck filled with
little streams of perspiration.  "Miss Agnese
an' de priest man air waitin' fo' yo' to come
down to supper, honey, an' Miss Agnese say
hurry, de cakes gwine git cold," she said in a
full rich voice; but Madeline only caught her
by the shoulder, and stared at her thick brown
skin, her coarse crinkled hair, her protruding
lips, and broad figure.  So her grandmother
might have looked.  "Fo' mercy's sake,
honey, what's de matter?  Air yo' sick?"
cried Aunt Dilsey in a frightened, anxious
tone; but the girl only turned from her, and
fell upon the bed with a moan of despair.

She heard the old negress hurrying downstairs,
and then her mother's light swift steps,
and tried to compose herself.

"My darling, what is the matter?" cried
Mrs. Capelle, bending tenderly, anxiously over
her.

"It is only a—a—headache," said Madeline,
glad that the twilight hid her face from those
loving, searching eyes.

"Are you sure?  Dilsey frightened me so."

"Dilsey is a foolish old creature."

Mrs. Capelle felt of her hands, her face.

"You are feverish.  You were in the hot sun
too much this afternoon."

"Yes; that was it—the sun.  Don't be
anxious, mama.  It is nothing.  Go back to
Father Vincent, and I'll sleep, and be well
to-morrow."

"But I do not like to leave you."

"You must, *chérie*.  Remember your guest."

"Yes, yes; so I must.  I will come up again
presently."

She stooped to arrange a pillow, and to kiss
her, and Madeline raised herself up, threw her
arms around her.

"My own good, sweet mama, my dear, lovely
one!" she murmured.  "You do everything
for my comfort and happiness.  You would
not hurt me for the world, would you?"

"Hurt you, sweet?"

"I know you would not.  I—I like to tease
you a little.  Kiss me good-night, and go.
*Poor mama!*" she murmured under her
breath, as they held each other, in a love no
bond of flesh and blood could have made
stronger.

"How can I tell her that I know!  How
can I!" Madeline moaned when left again
alone.

.. vspace:: 2

But she did not have that cruel task, for
sometime during that night, while she turned
wakefully on her bed, or paced softly about
the room, Agnese Capelle received the
summons she had been so long expecting.  Next
morning only her fragile body lay between the
white sheets of her bed, the life, the spirit
gone.

Madeline was strangely calm through all
the excitement and confusion following, and
went herself to select a sunny open spot in the
neglected little cemetery for her mother's
grave.

"She loved sunshine," she said to Everett
and Father Vincent, "and she wished to be
buried here."

She preserved the same stony quiet through
the funeral and burial, and friends commented
and wondered, and Roger watched her
anxiously.  He felt an indefinable change in her,
but attributed it to the shock of her mother's
sudden death.  Father Vincent studied him
with keen eyes, but could find no fault.  He
was a manly man, and a tender, considerate
lover.

It was the third evening after her mother's
burial that Madeline called Father Vincent
into the little study adjoining the parlor.
The New Orleans lawyer had come up, held a
private interview with her, and had gone away
again, and she had sent off her wedding trousseau
to a young girl in a distant town, and certain
things belonging to her mother she had
carefully collected and put together.  So
much Aunt Dilsey, the priest, and a kind old
lady who proposed to stay with her a few days
knew; but she offered no explanation, and
gave no clue to her plans for the future.

"She acts for all the world like she didn't
expect to get married, herself," the old lady
confided to a friend or two.  "I can't
understand what she intends to do."

Father Vincent felt some curiosity too, and
went into the little room rather eagerly.  She
sat before her mother's desk with a lot of
papers open before her.  It came upon him with
the force of surprise that she had changed
greatly in a few days.  Her features were
sharpened, her eyes had purplish hollows
under them, and the dull black gown she wore
only brought out the intense pallor of her
face.

"My child, where did you get those papers?
You must let me examine them.  There are
some your mother wished destroyed," said the
priest, hastily.

"I know, Father, I know," she said in a
dull tone.

"Have you—"

"Read them?  No; but I heard all that she
told you that day."

"Ah!" he exclaimed, understanding why
she looked so changed, and his eyes rested
pityingly upon her.  A fiery blush burned her
throat and face for a moment, leaving her paler
than ever when it receded.

"Yes; I know," she said, and clasped her
hands together on her lap.  "Father, will you
tell Mr. Everett?"

"But—"

"I cannot do it; help me, will you?"

It was a piteous appeal, and his heart melted
at the sight of her anguished eyes.

"You think he ought to know it?"

"He must, of course," she said, and he felt
satisfied that she had not, for a moment even,
been tempted to keep the truth from him.
"He is in the parlor," she continued after a
slight pause; "tell him all, spare nothing,"
her tensely drawn lips quivering, her hands
tightly clenched.

"My child, you take it too hard," laying his
hand on her head.  "I am grieved for you,
but do not let it spoil your peace."

"How can I help it, Father, with the training
I have had?  I cannot change my beliefs
in a day.  Oh, you know how my friends
would shrink from me if they knew the truth,
and I—I cannot blame them.  I should do the
same.  There is no help, no comfort, for me
anywhere."

"There is the comfort of the Church, the
help of Heaven."

"Ah, yes; I forget—I forget."

"But hear your lover before you decide your
future.  He has a right to it, remember."

"Tell him, Father, tell him."

He went away, and, turning the light a little
lower, she waited.  He made the story short, for
in a few minutes the door opened again and her
lover entered.  She rose to meet him, determined
to be brave and self-possessed, but that new,
bitter sense of shame again overpowered her.
She seemed to shrink and shrivel under his
tender eyes, and sank down with bowed head.  But
he knelt by her chair with his arms around her,
and drew that proud, averted face against him.

"Dearest, dearest," he whispered, the very
tone of his voice carrying to her his sympathy,
his unshaken love.

"I thank God that I learned the truth in
time," she said faintly.

"In time for what, Madeline?"

"To save you."

He raised her face, forced her to look at him.

"Do you believe my love has changed?"

"It has an element of pity now."

"But pity for your suffering, and not because
I hold you less noble.  I can take care of
myself and you also, my darling.  Father Vincent
and I agree that it will be best for you to go
North, get away from old associations, old
ideas; so we'll be married quietly, and leave
here at once."  He rose, and she stood up also,
facing him, looking straight into his eyes.

"Did Father Vincent tell you *all*?  Do you
realize just what I am?"

"Yes; you are the woman I love—my
promised wife.  Can I hold you blamable,
dearest, or unlove you simply because—come,
Madeline, put all the past behind you, and we
will never speak of this again."

"Impossible, Roger.  You are generous, and
I'm not afraid that you would ever reproach
me, but it is not worth while for us to argue
the matter.  We cannot marry.  In my own
sight I have been humbled into the dust, and
as your wife I should always have a cringing,
cowardly feeling of unworthiness.  I could not
be happy myself, and my misery would only
overshadow you.  Don't think me unreasonable
or lacking in love.  Love!  It fills all my
heart, pervades every atom of my being.  I
loved you at once—the first moment, I think,
that my eyes rested upon you.  The prejudices
which seemed so foolish, so false, are interwoven,
blended with life itself.  We, here, call
them instincts, holding us apart from the lower
order of man, and my education only fostered,
developed them to the utmost in me."

"If your mother had only—"

"Don't think hardly of her, my dearest.
She is not to blame.  She brought me up as
she believed best, and implanted the principles
and beliefs she thought would be my surest
safeguards.  As she grew weak and ill the
secret burdened her, and for fear that she might
be wronging you she sought Father Vincent's
advice.  How I thanked God that she died
without knowing that her work was all
undone!"  She flung herself again into the chair,
and he saw that she was too excited, too
overwrought, to be reasoned with.

She looked up at him.

"Had you known my birth, my parentage,
from the first, could you have loved me?"

"I do not know," he said candidly; "I only
know that I do love you, and that I will not
give you up."  His face flushed, his eyes
kindled.  "You must, you shall, be my wife.  But
we will not talk of it any more to-night: you
need rest, and time to recover from the double
shock which has come upon you.  To-morrow—every
day, I shall come, until you learn to
look at this as I do.  Good-night, Madeline.
Think wisely, reasonably, dear."

"I will try; and you will know my decision
to-morrow, Roger."

He bent over her, kissed the bright waves
of her hair; but she started up, and clasped
her arms about him, drawing his lips down to
hers in an abandonment of love she had never
shown before.  Tears rained from her eyes, the
stony curves of her mouth melted, and he felt
that it was a tacit surrender.

"To-morrow you will listen to me, Madeline,"
he said with the certainty of conviction.

"Yes; to-morrow," she replied, and turned,
weeping, from him.

But when he came next morning Father
Vincent met him at the door, while the old
lady and Aunt Dilsey hovered in the hall with
frightened, excited faces.  Fear, vague, indefinite,
but chilling, fell upon him.  He had spent
half the night in thinking and planning; he
had felt assured that it needed only time and
change of scene to restore Madeline to her
former brightness; but even if a cloud should
always hang over her, he wished to share its
gloom.  He could not fully appreciate her
position, because he could not look at it from
her standpoint.  He could understand that
it had been a cruel blow to her, but he could
not understand how tragical.  He felt very
hopeful as he walked over to her home, but
the face of the priest, those women in the
background, startled him.

"What is the matter?" he cried sharply.

"She is gone," said Father Vincent.

"Gone!" he echoed, paling suddenly, and
half reeling.

"Yes."

"Where?  In God's name, where?"

"That is what we do not know.  She must
have gone away on the early train this morning."

The blood came back to the young man's
face, a hideous fear lifted from his mind.

"You do not think then—"

"No; a Capelle would never seek self-destruction."

Everett stood still and looked about the
hall and through the open doors into the silent
rooms, yesterday filled with the sweet influence
of her presence, to-day empty, desolate, and a
terrible sense of loss swept over him.  Her
words, "You will know my decision to-morrow,"
came back to his memory with crushing
significance.

"Fool, fool that I have been!" he groaned
aloud, and the priest took him by the arm and
led him into the parlor.

"The women think her mind has been upset
by her mother's sudden death.  It is well;
let all her friends think so.  But we must find
her, Mr. Everett."

"Yes; I will go at once," said Roger, rousing
himself.  "It is to hide from me that she
has gone away; but I shall find her, I shall
certainly find her."

He spoke firmly and quietly, but the task
before him proved very hard, for she had left no
written message, no clue to her plans or
destination.

It was a spring day in the year 1886 that
Roger Everett turned aside from the beaten
track of the tourist in New Orleans to visit a
school in the old quarter of the city—a school
maintained by a few New England philanthropists
for colored children exclusively.  He lost
his bearings in the narrow streets among the
quaint old-fashioned houses, and stopped to
make inquiries at a small building opening on
the street.  He rapped on the half-closed
wooden shutter with his stick, his eyes
meanwhile wandering up and down the silent, sunny
street, absently noting the scant, picturesque
attire of some brown-faced children at play on
the sidewalk and the pathetic figure of an old
negro sitting on a doorstep.  His failure to find
Madeline Capelle had left its traces upon his
face.  Five years had elapsed since her
disappearance, and though he had not ceased to
look into every woman's face he met, he had
given up hope of finding her.  A serene-eyed
woman in a black gown and cap came to the
door, and he instantly recognized the dress as
the uniform of some religious order or sisterhood.

"Come in," she said in a gentle, subdued tone.

"I beg your pardon.  I merely wished to—"

"It will not be an intrusion.  Many have
already come to-day to see her, for you know
many love her.  This way, please," she said,
and without waiting for him to speak again,
she turned and walked through two rather
bare, dusky rooms into a small one opening
on a green, magnolia-shaded court.  He
followed her, puzzled, but with a touch of
curiosity, wondering how he should explain
himself; but the moment he crossed the threshold
he understood the mistake that she had made,
for in the centre of the room stood a
white-draped bier, and through the unfolded linen
he could trace the outline of a rigid human
form.

"See the flowers," his conductress whispered,
pointing to the masses of cape jasmines,
roses, and smaller flowers.  "Sister Christiana
loved them, but she loved all things beautiful
and good.  They were brought this morning
by negroes she has been kind to.  To teach,
to elevate, and to nurse them has been her
mission.  No service seemed too humble, no
duty too hard for her.  She did indeed 'belong
to Christ.'"

Her mild eyes kindled, her hand instinctively
sought the cross at her side.

"She died calmly and with joy, and knew us
until the last moment."

He followed her across the room, treading
softly, as we always do in the presence of death.
With reverent hand she laid aside the shielding
linen, and he leaned forward—the past
once more a vivid reality and not a memory,
not a dream vanishing from him, for the face
he looked down upon was the face of Madeline Capelle.

   AN OLD-TIME LOVE STORY.

.. vspace:: 2

The Galers lived on the summit of a long
hill sloping down to the brink of the
Chattahoochee River, and nearly opposite the small
town of Roswell.  Above the house and below
it stretched the fertile acres of a fine plantation
worked by many slaves; for old Jabez Galer
was rich in land and negroes, besides owning
a large interest in a wool factory over the
river.  Roswell was really the most important
manufacturing town in Georgia before the
War, though it was scattered so picturesquely
over the river hills with no railroad market
nearer than Atlanta.

But it does not enter the province of this
short sketch to give a history of the old town
with its factories scattered along short canals,
fed from the river, its traditions reaching back
into the early days of the settling of
Georgia—its "lover's leap" on the brink of a wide
creek, a cliff of gray rocks with lovely maidenhair
ferns growing thickly around its base—but
of the Galers living across the river from it in
the midst of their small kingdom, surrounded
by their black retainers, and of an old love
story.

The house was big and white and squarely
built, with the piazzas—without which no
Southern house would have seemed complete—wide
halls and large rooms belonging to a
certain period of colonial architecture.  The
lower hall was ornamented with the antlers of
a stag or two, some leopard-skin rugs, and
with a stuffed owl perched above the door.
The rooms wrere sparely furnished after the
stiff fashion of the day, but linen closets and
clothes-presses were full and overflowing; for
there wrere swift spinners and skillful weavers
among the negro women on the place, and a
careful mistress to look after them.  In the
rear of the main dwelling were the negro
quarters, and off at one side the barns and
stables.  The grassy lawn was shaded with
fine old oaks and mimosa trees.  In the back
yard the little negroes disported, and a dozen
hounds had their kennels; for Mr. Jabez Galer
was fond of riding forth over the river hills in
the early dawn, with dogs and gun and
hunting-horn.  His family consisted of himself, his
meek, gentle sister, Miss Jane, and his
grand-daughter, fair Pamela.

Mr. Jabez Galer was a character in his day
and generation.  He was impulsive and could
be generous, but had a most tyrannical will
and a violent temper.  He ruled his household
like an autocrat.  There was something
domineering in his very tread, the roll of his keen
eye, the fit of the white linen arraying his
portly person.  He was a rather fine-looking
old man, gray-haired and blue-eyed, and with
evidences of good living in every line of his
clean-shaven face.  No man could be more
genial than he when in a good humor, or
appreciate a story or a joke more keenly; and he
was kind to his negroes.  True, they did not
dare disobey him without expecting and
receiving punishment, and they worked hard;
but they were well clothed, housed and fed,
and enjoyed their regular holidays and merrymakings.

Mr. Galer's doors were always open to the
wandering prospector, the trader, the itinerant
preacher, or, indeed, to any one who claimed
his hospitality and seemed worthy of it, and
his sister and granddaughter were free to
entertain or be entertained by the society of
Roswell; but his guests sometimes came in
contact with his imperious will or his temper.  To
show what manner of man he was one
experience is herein given:

A Kentucky horse-trader stopped at the
house one night, and long after the other
members of the family had retired he sat in
the dining-room with his host drinking wine
and telling stories.  They both grew
somewhat excited as the mellow vintage warmed
their fancies.  They told adventures of
youthful gallantry.  Mr. Galer had, in his time,
figured prominently in society as a beau,
dancing and paying compliments; and the
Kentuckian admitted that he had also once felt
proud of his nimble-footedness in treading the
cotillon.  He was invited to give an example
of his skill, but declined.  His host insisted,
but he laughed contemptuously at the idea.
Old Jabez Galer's choler rose.  He went to
the dining-room door and shouted for his own
special servant, Elbert.

"Elbert, hey there!  Elbert, you rascal,
bring down your fiddle!"

An old negro man stumbled down the back
stairway and into the room, rubbing open his
sleepy eyes, a much abused and battered
violin under his arm.  He looked older than
his master, his woolly head quite white, a
complex tracery of wrinkles covering his shrewd
black face; but he seemed active and strong,
and betrayed not the slightest surprise at the
midnight summons.

"Mars Galer up tu some mischief, sho'," he
muttered, sitting down, with his feet drawn up
under him, and beginning to tune the violin.
He gave a few preparatory scrapes across the
strings, and then began to play the old
inspiring tunes his dusky people had danced to
round many a brightly blazing bonfire, or in
the light of the full moon.  Mr. Galer turned
the key in the door, reached down the gun
resting in a rack above it, and deliberately
leveled it at his astonished guest.

"Now dance, or I'll put a bullet through
your head."

The Kentuckian was not a coward, but he
had no weapon—how he longed for the pistols
in his saddle-bags!—and realized that his host
might do him mischief if not humored.

It was a curious scene, an extremely ludicrous
one.  The candles, set in tall, brass
candlesticks, sputtered and flared, the tallow
melting down in a little gutter on one side.
They cast only an uncertain, flickering light
over the room, and the tall, awkward Kentuckian,
in creaking boots, shuffled over the
bare floor until the house fairly trembled, and
Miss Jane turned on her high feather bed in
a chamber above, wondering what unseemly
sport could be going on.  But the victim of
Mr. Galer's whims was a wary man and given
to dissimulation when occasion required.  He
appeared to find such humor in the situation
that his host was thrown entirely off guard
and allowed the gun to rest negligently on the
table in front of him.  In a twinkling it was
snatched from his loosened grasp, and the
Kentuckian stood between him and the door.

"Now you try your skill awhile, Mr. Galer,
or you may play best man at the funeral," he
said, grimly.

It was a neat revenge, and instead of trying
to rouse the household to his protection
Mr. Galer promptly began to keep time to the
music with slow, old-fashioned steps.  But he
had lost the lightness and skill of his youth,
and, soon exhausted, had to beg for mercy.
Elbert's eyes twinkled in secret glee over his
master's discomfiture, and he played a livelier
strain than ever.  Mr. Galer and the trader
parted the next morning in the friendliest
manner, and he told the story of his defeat
with the keenest appreciation.

With such a disposition to override all
opposition to his wishes and desires, it is not to
be supposed that his family had an easy life of
it when wills clashed.  It was only by
stratagem that they could ever outwit him; and it
was by stratagem that Pamela married the
man she loved.  It happened in this wise:

Adjoining Mr. Galer's plantation was one
even larger and richer, belonging to
Mr. Josiah Williamson, a man who had abundance
of money, and was amply able to take life
easy.  He went away annually on a trip to the
principal Northern cities, and even talked of
some time going abroad.  He and old Jabez
Galer were warm friends, and it had long been
understood between them that Pamela should
become Mrs. Josiah Williamson when she arrived
at a suitable age.  At the date of this story she
had reached eighteen, and her grandfather's
plans for her future began to take active shape.
One morning he stamped into the hall,
threw his hat and riding-whip on a table,
shouting in thundering tones:

"Permely!  Per*me*ly! hey, Perme*lee!*"

The little negroes rolling in the sand in the
back yard scampered away behind the kitchen,
Miss Jane dropped the fine linen she was
mending in the dining-room, and Elbert
muttered over a half-polished boot: "Mars Jabe
in one o' his tantrums 'g'in, ez I live."

"What is it, grandpa?" inquired a youthful
voice from the upper hall, and Pamela stepped
lightly down the broad, shallow stairs.

"Come here to me," he said, but in a softer
tone; for she held the tenderest place in his
heart; and she was fair enough to disarm even
greater anger than his.  She was a tall young
person, with a certain charming dignity of
carriage, a rather pale but lovely face, fine,
pale brown hair, and steel-gray eyes.  There
was no vivid coloring about her, though
plenty of character lay under that soft,
subdued beauty.  She was gowned in thin muslin
befitting the summer day, with a narrow
lace collar turned down around her slender
neck.  Mr. Galer laid his hands heavily on
her shoulders, looking sternly into her clear
eyes.

"What's this I hear about you and Sim Black?"

She looked down, and the whiteness of her
face and throat turned to rose.

"I *would* hang my head," giving her a
slight shake.  "What do you suppose that
young beggar had the impudence to do this
morning when I went over to Roswell? to ask
me for you—you—old Jabez Galer's grand-daughter;
declared that he had always loved
you, and that it was with your consent he came
to me."

"Yes sir," she said, in a low tone, tracing a
seam in the floor with the toe of her neat little
shoe.

He stamped the floor.  "Well, he'll not get
you, do you hear?  Do you think I raised you,
educated you, to marry a miserable little
lawyer without a rood of land or a nigger to his
name?  No, sirrah!"

"I thought you always intended me to be
happy, sir," paling again before his wrath, but
firm.

"So I do, but you'll be happy in my way,
marry the man I have selected for you, and
his name is—Josiah Williamson."

She stared at him in a disconcertingly
amazed, shocked way.

"*Why, grandpa!*"

"What's the matter, now?"

"He's as old as you are."

"He is not a year older than your aunt Jane."

"And I love Sim, dear grandpa," she pleaded.

"Don't you dare to think of him again!
Williamson—"

"I will certainly not think of *him*," with a
flash of her eyes.

"I have forbidden Black ever coming here
again, and I'll wear him out with a cowhide if
I ever hear of your speaking to him."

"Brother, brother," remonstrated Miss
Jane's exasperatingly gentle voice from the
dining-room door, her small person half
hidden in an armful of mending.

"Don't 'brother' me!  What have you been
doing, not to look after this girl?  But women
are contrary creatures, all of them, and enough
to drive a man distracted with their piety and
sentimental foolishness!"

He went out upon the piazza, and sat down
to let his vexation cool, while Pamela was
folded in her grandaunt's comforting little
arms, to the detriment of the linen, which
received a copious shower of tears.  But if she
wept she was also determined.  As old
Elbert had once shrewdly said:

"Miss Pamely's er Galer, too, en got de
Galer will, en de Galer temper, en things
gwinter fly to pieces when she en ole Mars
come tugether."

Mr. Galer sat on the piazza; but he waxed
wroth every time he thought of young Black's
presumption.  Stretching afar before his eyes
were his own cotton-fields, girdled on one side
by the winding curves of the Chattahoochee,
and on the other by deep, green forests, and
through the palpitant air of the summer noon
floated a field song, chanted by the joyous
mellow voices of his slaves.  His heart
swelled with the pride of riches.  Sim Black,
indeed! when Pamela could have the pick and
choice of the country, by right of her beauty
and her dowry.  What if the young lawyer did
possess a brilliant mind and an eloquent
tongue, and culture far beyond the average
man in that region? he had sprung from
obscure origin, and his future honors were as yet
but empty promises, while Josiah Williamson's
wealth and position were solid facts.

That afternoon, as Pamela sat in her room
bending listlessly over some gay patchwork,
Mammy Susannah came in, and from under
the kerchief folded across her bosom, drew a
little note.

"Honey, Elbert say, fo' de lub o' de Lawd
not tu let old Mars know 'e fetch dis."

Pamela sprang up, flushing and trembling,
to receive her first love-letter.  It was brief:

"*Dearest:*—As your grandfather has forbidden me
to enter his house again, I shall walk by the althea
hedge in your garden this evening where, I pray you,
meet me.

   "Your devoted Lover,
       "JOHN SIMPSON BLACK."

.. vspace:: 2

Mr. Josiah Williamson came a-wooing that
evening just as twilight fell and the
whippoorwill began his plaintive serenade.  The
negroes understood his errand, from the groom,
who put up his horse, to the pickaninny
peeping around the corner of the house; and
there were nods and winks exchanged as he
came nimbly up the piazza steps arrayed in his
finest broadcloth and newest, tightest neck-stock.

He and Mr. Galer sat on the piazza and
chatted awhile of plantation affairs, of the
latest news from Washington, and of a public sale
of slaves which had recently occurred in Roswell;
and Miss Jane sat in the candle-lit parlor,
knitting; but Pamela had disappeared.

"Can I—ahem—speak to Miss Permely, this
evening?" Mr. Williamson at last inquired.
"Your note led me to hope so."

"Yes; I want that matter settled.  I'll see
if she's with her aunt."

But Miss Jane mused solitarily over the
stocking heel, a great white winged moth
circling about her meek head or diving ever
and anon toward the flame of the candle.

"Where is Permely?" Mr. Galer inquired,
frowning.

She dropped one of the long, shining needles
with a clinking sound, and stooped to grope
around the edge of her skirts for it.

"Why, Jabez, I don't know; I thought—"

"Leave your thoughts out of the question,
Jane, and go call her.  She is hiding
somewhere about the house."

Miss Jane stood up and faced him, nerved to
a fleeting courage.

"Brother, don't try to force the child into a
loveless marriage.  Think how young she is;
think—"

"Do as I tell you, Jane; I know what is best
for Permely;" and she silently obeyed.

But Mammy Susannah, hovering in the
shadow of the stairway, had already slipped
out into the garden.  It was a beauty's bower.
The rising moon shone on beds of tulip and
mignonette, on rows of flaunting hollyhocks,
blue larkspur and yellow marigolds, on sweet
pinks standing thickly in the border of the
walks, and roses bending earthward under the
weight of their own rich bloom and fragrance;
its silvered light fell on the althea hedge with
its white and purple flowers, and on Pamela
and her lover slowly pacing the walk beyond.

"Miss Pemely, honey!" Susannah called,
low and cautiously.

She hurriedly withdrew her hand from Sim's
clasp.

"I must go; grandpa wants me."

But he threw his arms about her to detain
her a moment longer, loth to part from her so
quickly.  Their two young faces were almost
on a level; for Black was short and dark,
though strongly built, and square-shouldered,
with keen black eyes, and a handsome, clean-shaven
face.  His eyes were alight with love's
soft fire as they rested on her face.

"I cannot let you go so soon, beloved," he
protested, tenderly.

"Ah, but think of grandpa's anger, should
he find you here."

"It would take a stout heart to face it,
I acknowledge," he said laughing.  Then he
took her face between his hands: "You'll not
let them take you from me, Pamela?"

"Indeed I will not, Sim."

Her sweet eyes and mouth were kissed, and
then Black vaulted over the low garden fence,
while she hastened to the house, her light
skirts brushing the tell-tale dew from flower
and seeded grass, her fine, soft hair hanging
damply around her throat and delicate ears.

It is not the purpose of this chronicle to give
a minute account of Mr. Josiah Williamson's
wooing, nor of its failure.  Mr. Galer lived in a
state of vexation from morning until night.
He was nearly beside himself with baffled rage
when he found that with characteristic family
spirit Pamela declined to be cajoled or
coerced into obedience.  All his ambitious plans
threatened a total collapse; and that the
obstinacy of a slim young girl should be the
cause made it all the more aggravating.  He
thought of a hundred schemes by which he
might overcome her contrary spirit, but only
one appeared feasible.  He chuckled grimly
over it, and sent for Mr. Williamson to unfold
his plan to him.

"I'll pretend to give my consent to her
marriage with Black, set the day, invite the
guests, and then contrive to have Sim detained
over in Roswell, put in jail if it's necessary,
but let Permely think he's changed his mind.
Girls are touchy creatures, and Permely is so
proud that she would marry you in a minute
rather than not have a wedding at all."

It was not a situation to Mr. Williamson's
liking.  He wanted no unwilling bride; and
Pamela had shown her aversion for him so
plainly that he was entirely disenchanted.
But he dared not sav so.  Like all of Mr. Galer's
friends, he stood in wholesome fear of that
gentleman's temper.

"Well, what do you say?" his friend
impatiently demanded.

"It seems a little—er—don't you think—"

"Oh, if you don't wish to marry my grand-daughter,
pray say so."

"But I do, I do," said Mr. Williamson, feeling
himself a miserable coward for not protesting
against deceiving the girl.

When he went away it was with the understanding
that the whole matter must be kept a
secret between them.  But as he rode dejectedly
around the corner of the garden, who
should step out in front of him but Miss Jane
Galer, such a sparkle of indignation in her
eyes, such a flush on her delicate face, that she
looked positively young and pretty.  He stared
at her, and she, without so much as a polite
good-morning, said:

"I want to know, Josiah Williamson, if you
are not ashamed of yourself for plotting
against a young girl's happiness?"

"Blame your brother, Miss Jane—blame
your brother," he said, in self-defense, having
the grace to look very much ashamed of
himself, though.

"You know he'd almost sell his own soul for
the privilege of having his way; but you—I
think you ought to have more pride than to want
to marry Permely through fraud.  What peace
or pleasure do you think there would be in it?"

"Not much for me, I'll allow," he said,
flicking the willow switch he carried at the flies
swarming about his horse's head.  "Miss
Permely hasn't shown her best temper to me
lately, and I don't know as I care to marry her at
all.  I want somebody that'll take life quietly
and gently."

He looked down again at Miss Jane.  She
smoothed out her black silk apron, still
trembling with indignation.

"No better-tempered girl lives than Permely
Galer; but think of the sore trial of being
pestered all the time about marrying one man
while she is in love with another.  I heard all
that brother Jabez said to you, and if you don't
give up the idea of this marriage I'll tell
Permely and Sim, and, more than that, I'll do all
I can to help them if they want to run away."

Mr. Williamson was fascinated by her
unexpected fire and spirit.

"I didn't know you were so spunky, Jane,"
he said, admiringly.  "We used to go to
school together, do you remember?"

"Why yes," she replied, surprised at the
turn of his thoughts.

"You were a gentle little thing, but you had
temper enough then.  You look, for all the
world, as you did the day Eben Sanders gave
me such a thrashing."

She smiled faintly at the recollection.
There were others hidden deep in her heart.
Nobody knew that in those school days she
had cherished many romantic fancies about
Josiah Williamson, or what a blow it was to
her when he went off and married a girl from
another settlement.  She had been on
friendly terms with his wife, and had so far
overcome her own feelings as to feel deeply,
sincerely grieved when she died.  Mr. Williamson
dismounted and stood at her side.

"I don't know as I'd tell Jabez I overheard
his plans if I were you.  Maybe we can fix up
the matter without that," he said, persuasively.

"I cannot have Permely cheated out of her
happiness," she said.

"She shall not be cheated, I promise you."

But apparently his promise amounted to
very little, as Mr. Galer went on maturing his
plans, inviting young Black to his house, and
sending away to Atlanta for Pamela's wedding
outfit.  His conscience smote him for his
duplicity when the girl rapturously thanked
him for his goodness; he wondered what she
would say when she discovered the trick
played upon her.

"Pshaw! she'll be glad enough for it when
she comes to her senses.  Women are never
sane when they fancy they are in love."

Mr. Williamson behaved in the most discreet
and admirable manner, showing only the interest
of a familiar, elderly friend in Pamela's
approaching marriage; but Miss Jane went
about in a nervous, half-terrified way that
attracted even her brother's attention.

"Any one would suppose that you were to
be married, too!" he exclaimed one day.

"Oh, Jabez!" she gasped, and fled from his
presence, while he contemptuously muttered:
"What idiots women are!"

The morning of the wedding-day dawned at
last; and while the dew still hung heavy upon
grass and flowers, Pamela declared that she
must run over to Roswell for a piece of white
ribbon.  Mr. Galer frowned a little as he saw
her hasten away in a crisp, white gown and a
new calash, fair as the morning itself; and
he grumblingly wondered why he could not
have attended to the errand himself, unwilling
to let her leave the place until she was safely
married.  Mammy Susannah accompanied her,
and the two came back in a short time, Pamela
flushed and trembling with an inward glow of
happiness.  She ran to her grandfather and
threw her arms about his neck for a moment, the
little package of ribbon unrolling itself over his
waistcoat; then she embraced and kissed Miss
Jane, who seemed no less agitated than she.

A great feast was spread that evening, and
the wedding guests poured in until the crowd
overflowed from the parlor into the great wide
hall.  Mr. Galer was a genial host, and even
while he braced himself for the inevitable
scene with Pamela when Sim failed to appear—and
he had arranged with the town marshal
that the young man should be detained—he
moved about among the guests talking in his
most agreeable manner.  It was a little early,
but the minister had already placed himself in
position for the ceremony.  Mr. Galer laughed
jovially.

"Plenty of time—plenty of time yet," he
exclaimed.  "Young folks are never prompt;"
but even as he spoke silence fell upon the
company, as through the doorway and down
the room walked Mr. Josiah Williamson.
But who was it leaning upon his arm, her gray
silk gown rustling softly, her frightened face
alternately flushing and paling like a girl's,
her meek eyes cast down?  Mr. Galer fell
back, fumbling for his glasses, doubting the
evidence of his natural vision.  Could it
be—could it be—yes, it was Miss Jane.  Then he
saw Sim Black standing boldly in the doorway
with Pamela at his side, and the sight
restored his speech and motion and he strode
across the floor to them, just as the minister
concluded the brief ceremony uniting the
elderly couple, and laid his hand on the girl's
shoulder.

"I can at least have my say about *this* part
of the wedding."

But Sim clasped her hand in his, his black
eyes, every feature of his handsome, strong
young face betraying his joy and triumph.

"You are too late, sir; she is my wife."

"We were married in Roswell this morning.
Forgive us, grandpa," said Pamela.

When he realized that he had been the one
cheated, outwitted, his anger knew no bounds.
He refused to listen to explanation or excuse,
but turned everybody out of the house, gave
the wedding supper to the negroes, and shut
himself into his own room.  But he had been
fairly beaten at his own game, and in time he
came to appreciate it, and to look with pride
on Sim Black's career, while he and Josiah
Williamson ended their years in brotherly
love and peace.

   HOW THE QUARREL ENDED.

.. vspace:: 2

When old Killus Hurd dismounted from his
horse before the Hardings' front gate one spring
day, it was not to make a neighborly visit.  The
flash of his eyes, the set of his mouth, boded
no good and mild temper.  He was a strong,
vigorous-looking man for his years, and larger
than the average mountaineer.  He walked
erect, his brown jeans and homespun clothing
fitting loosely, his gray hair falling from under
a well-worn broad-brimmed hat to his shoulders.

The Hardings lived on a settlement road at
the foot of Bush Mountain, in a weather-beaten
old log-house, shaded by a fine chestnut-oak,
and a towering spruce pine.  The widow Harding
sat out on the low piazza shelling seed
corn into a small splint basket, and she stared
at the approaching visitor with surprise and
displeasure.  She was a middle-aged woman,
but looked older, with dust-colored hair,
sallow, sunken features, and faded blue eyes.
Mrs. Long, a neighbor who had dropped in to
borrow some dye-stuff and to beg a few garden
seed, sat near her, rubbing snuff, and retailing
the latest gossip circulating through the settlement.
At the sight of Mr. Hurd she paused in
astonishment.

"Lizy Ann Harding, thar comes Killus
Hurd, ez I live!"

"I'm a-seein' him," said Mrs. Harding, her
fingers trembling over the yellow corn.

"Good-mornin', Mis' Harding; hope you air
well as you wanter be, Mis' Long," he said,
walking up to the piazza step.

"Will you come in an' take a cheer?" said
Mrs. Harding, the laws of hospitality forcing
her to be polite even to her enemy.

"Yes, for a minute or two, Mis' Harding,"
he replied, and sat down opposite her, resting
his hat on his knees.

Mrs. Long took a fresh dip of snuff, and
hitched her chair a little nearer, expectant and
curious.  A brief silence fell, but it was simply the
stillness forerunning a storm.  The shrill voices
of the boys at work in the field below the house
were distinctly audible, and from the kitchen,
at the edge of the back yard, sounded the
steady click-clack of a loom, plied by a strong,
industrious hand.

A bitter feud existed between the Hurds and
the Hardings.  It dated back to the days when
Killus Hurd and Sam Harding were young, and
sprang from a dispute over some gold diggings.
Unfilled trenches marked the spot where they
first quarreled, and as the years seemed to wear
the earth away into a deeper chasm, so the
break between the two families widened until it
passed into history in the settlement.  The men
were members of the same church, their farms
adjoined, their homes were not over a mile
apart, but they would not be reconciled.  At
last death claimed Sam Harding, and a new
grave had to be made in the shadow of the
"meetin'-house," where the Hurds and the
Hardings of a former generation rested side by
side in peace.

He had been dead two years, and all outward
signs of hostility had ceased; but the elder
members of the families had not forgotten.  And
when Mr. Hurd sat down before Mrs. Harding
that morning, her thin cheeks flushed, her faded
eyes gathered fire; she had plenty of spirit.

"Mis' Harding, where is that daughter o' your'n?"

The mode of attack confused her for a moment.

"Do you mean Sarah Betsy?"

"Yes, I mean Sarah Betsy."

"She's in the kitchen a-weavin'."

"Yes; but where is she when outen your sight?"

"What's that to you, Mister Hurd?" straightening
up, and looking unflinchingly at him.

"Mebby you'll 'low it's a good deal when I
tell you she's a-goin' to meetin' with John, an'
a-seein' him at singin's an' frolics an' such.  It's
got to be stopped, Mis' Harding.  God-a-mighty
knows John's been raised as he orter be, an' he
ain't a-goin' to spile it all by keepin' comp'ny
with a Harding."

He stamped on the floor in mingled grief
and rage, and Mrs. Long moved her chair back
a few inches.  The widow Harding did not
move, but a curious tightness in her throat
held her speechless for a moment.  Could it
indeed be true Sarah Betsy had so deceived
her?  She would not believe it.

"Mister Hurd, do you s'pose I'd 'low Sarah
Betsy to keep comp'ny with John?" she said,
clearing her throat as she talked.  "Sez
Harding to me when he lay a-dyin': 'I'm sorry
to leave you, Lizy Ann, but it ain't to be
helped, fer it's the Almighty's will.  Take keer o'
the chillun an' do the best you can for 'em;'
an' now, ruther than see Sarah Betsy a-throwin'
herself away on a son o' your'n I'd be
willin' to lay her down 'longside her pa."  Her
voice trembled and softened.  "She's
always been a good obejent child, an' I ain't
afraid o' trustin' her."

"But ain't I been told p'intedly that they
are courtin' on the sly, and didn't John 'low to
me this mornin' hisself that he'd marry Sarah
Betsy if he lived?  Call her and we'll hear what
she sez."

"To be sure," murmured Mrs. Long, while
Mrs. Harding raised her voice in a shrill call:

"Sarah Betsy!  Sarah Bet-see!"

She came quickly from the kitchen and
across the yard to the narrow entry leading to
the piazza, a rift of wind blowing her short
dark hair about her brow and white neck.
Her face was sunburned and slightly freckled,
though smooth and fresh as a nineteen-year-old
face should be.  Some day age, snuff-dipping
and bad diet would probably make her
as yellow and shriveled as her mother, but
now the potent charm of youth gave her
comeliness.  Her brown checked homespun dress
was neat, and its primitive fashion but served
to show the free grace of all her movements.

"Did you call me, Ma?" in a soft, slow
voice; then she saw Mr. Hurd and paused.

"Sarah Betsy, Mr. Hurd 'lows John an' you
has been a-keepin' comp'ny unbeknownst to
us," said her mother, looking seriously at her.

Sarah Betsy cast down her eyes and was silent.

"Jest speak out, Sarah Betsy," said Mr. Hurd,
grimly; "your ma don't 'pear to believe me."

"No; for I 'lowed that you had always
been a good child an' wouldn't go ag'in' me."

A quiver of strongly repressed emotion
passed over the girl's face.

"Oh, Ma, it couldn't be helped!"

Mrs. Harding rose up, then sat down again,
scattering the corn right and left in her
agitation, while Mrs. Long shook her head
compassionately, and old Killus Hurd looked
sternly triumphant.

"Do you mean to tell me Sam Harding's
daughter has plum' forgot all her pa's
teachin's?" the widow demanded, sternly.

"Ma, it ain't that.  I didn't 'low to keer fer
John, an' he didn't 'low to keer fer me, but it
jest gradually crope up on us," said the girl in
a faltering tone, her face deeply red.  She
looked appealingly from Mr. Hurd to her
mother.  "Don't turn ag'in' us.  We lowed it
wusn't right not to tell you, but—"

"It ain't no use to be a-palaverin' with your
ma, Sarah Betsy Harding," said Killus Hurd,
standing up to his full height, and eying her
sternly.  "It's me you've got to listen to, an'
if there is a spark o' pride or feelin' in your
heart, it's bound to be teched.  John's the last
child, out'n nine, that's been left to me an' his
ma; but I'll turn him out o' doors, I'll drive
him plum' from the country before he shall
marry you, an' the curse o' the Almighty shall
foller him."

"It ain't for human creeturs to say who the
Almighty's wrath must be turned against,"
said a mild, rebuking voice; and there at the
piazza step stood Sile Ed'ards, the preacher,
leaning on his stout stick, his deep-set
gray eyes fixed gravely upon the angry
neighbors.

A short embarrassed silence followed his
unexpected appearance.  Sarah Betsy retreated
to the doorway, and Mrs. Long laughed
awkwardly.

"You must 'a' jes' crope up, Brother Ed'ards,"
she said, with an attempt at lightness.

"Come in an' take a seat, won't you?" said
Mrs. Harding, recovering herself.

"Not to-day, Sister Harding.  I'm goin' up
on Bush Mount'in, an' I 'low to salt Dave
Martin's cattle while there."

Mr. Hurd put on his hat.  "I'll jest be goin',
Mis' Harding," he said, coldly.

"Won't you stay a minute?" asked the
preacher in his mild, slow voice.  "If it ain't
puttin' nobody out, I'd like to know what's the
matter."

The enemies each hastened to give an account
of the renewed quarrel, and its cause.
Sarah Betsy hung her head, and uttered not a
word, though conscious that more than once
Sile Ed'ards's deep grave eyes turned toward
her.  The story seemed to agitate him greatly.
He grew pale, and gripped his stick with
trembling fingers.  He sighed deeply.

"It's a serious question; but it 'pears to me
love might solve it.  If the Almighty wants to
bring you all together ag'in in peace by unitin'
John an' Sarah Betsy I don't think you ought
to rebel against his will.  The Scripters
say—"

"It ain't to be argued out on Scripter, Sile,"
interrupted Mr. Hurd, stubbornly.  "I ain't
thinkin' hard o' you or blamin' you for feelin'
that way; it's nachel, seein' as you've been called
to preach; but the Scripters don't fit ever' time."

"They will if we'll only 'low 'm to."

"Mis' Harding an' Sarah Betsy know what
I've said."

"I ain't apt to forgit some o' the hard things
you've said, Mister Hurd," the widow remarked,
in a tone trembling with indignation.

Ed'ards continued to argue and plead with
them.  The woman he might have softened,
but he found himself powerless before hard,
stern old Killus Hurd, nursing the concentrated
wrath and bitterness of years.

"'Tain't no use, Sile—'tain't no use," he said,
moving away to his horse.

"Them that forgives air to be forgiven," said
the preacher.

But the old man silently mounted and rode
away.  Mrs. Long was also ready to depart,
being eager to spread the news of the quarrel
throughout the settlement.

Ed'ards leaned against the rough sapling
post supporting the piazza, with head
dejectedly drooped.  Mrs. Harding wiped her eyes,
and looked furtively at him.  "Wouldn't you
like to take a cheer an' rest, Brother Ed'ards?"
she said, gently.  "I know it's sinful to carry
on the way we've been a-doin' this mornin', but
them Hurds are that mean an' no 'count—" she
paused, then hurriedly changed the subject.
"I'm most obleeged to take this corn down to
the fields."

"Don't let me hinder you then, for I must soon
be gittin' on my way.  I must ask wisdom 'fore
I say any more to you an' Brother Hurd—and
I must git strength for myself," he concluded,
half under his breath.  When left alone, he sat
down on the edge of the piazza a few minutes,
then walked slowly around the house to the
kitchen-door to speak a few words to Sarah
Betsy.

She sat on the bench before the loom, but
the shuttles lay idle on the beam, while she
leaned forward with her face hidden in her
hands.  So still and deep seemed her dejection
he would not disturb her, but stood gazing on
her drooped figure with yearning eyes.  He had
long secretly loved her, but had scarcely
realized that he indulged the hope of winning her
until he learned that her heart was given to
John Hurd.  He had been used to self-denial
all his life, and after the first confused sensation
of misery and loss, strove to put aside his own
feelings, and desire only her happiness.  He
had sought her to speak some comforting
words, but finding her in that attitude of silent
grief turned away, and left her alone.

He was a slender, undersized man, not more
than thirty years old; but mental and physical
suffering had drawn deep lines upon his thin,
sallow face, and sprinkled threads of gray in
his hair.  His features would have looked hard
and forbidding had they not been softened by
the strong, patient endurance religion had
brought to him.  Throughout the length and
breadth of Laurel Cove he was respected and
loved.  He belonged to the Cove; the encircling
chain of mountains marked the boundaries
of his life; for he was a hopeless cripple,
walking ever with slow, halting steps, and with a
staff to aid him.  He had never been a lusty,
vigorous youth, but one of unusual intelligence
and ambition.  It was a grievous blow to all
his plans of life when a falling tree lamed him.
It was a long time before he could walk, even
with a crutch, and years before he laid the
crutch aside for a stick.  Active labor would
never again be possible for him; but not liking
to be dependent on his neighbors for charity,
he plied the trade of a shoe-mender, and while
he worked he read and meditated on the Bible—the
only book he possessed, except a Webster's
*Speller* and a small arithmetic.  It was no
wonder that so much reading and solitary
thinking on religious themes should inspire him with
the desire to preach.  His tongue seemed
loosened; he rose in "meetin'," and exhorted the
people.  His eloquence amazed them; his fervor,
his deep sincerity impressed even the
callous-hearted.

His physical infirmity also appealed to them,
and it was not long before he became the
pastor of the church in Laurel Cove.  He had no
more education than his parishioners, so far as
text-books were concerned: but his spiritual
discernment gave him a power marvelous to
them.  He did a great deal of good, but one
thing he had set his heart on he failed to do;
he could not make peace between the Hurds
and the Hardings.  Both men sat under his
teachings in church and listened to his
exhortations outside, and both loved him; but they
would not be friends with each other.  When
Sam Harding died Sile tried to influence old
Killus Hurd to extend the hand of peace to
the widow; but he stubbornly refused, and the
preacher gave it up.  Now that a fresh quarrel
had come he knew not what to say or do,
particularly as his own feelings were so deeply
involved.  He had watched Sarah Betsy bloom
into womanhood, delighting in her beauty and
even admiring the girlish coquetry of her ways.
He had never cherished any definite hopes of
marrying her; what woman would like a cripple
for a husband? but as long as she did not
show any preference among her beaux he was
satisfied.  Now he knew why she smiled on all
alike.  It was because she secretly loved John
Hurd, and not because she was heart-free.  A
cruel, jealous pang pierced the heart of the
preacher, and a wave of rebellion, savage in
its fierceness, swept over him.  Why could he
not have the love of this girl?  It would be
only a just compensation for the loss of his
physical strength, and with it all he had hoped
to be.  For a moment he loathed his own
body: his spirit panted to rush forth upon the
air, freed from all its trammels of flesh.  He
was not conscious of a temptation to commit
suicide; but for an instant the vistas of Heaven
seemed to open on his longing eyes, the
perplexities and sorrows of life to roll away.
Death would be a sweet, a lovely friend to
him, not the grisly terror that so many shrank
from.  He knew every nook and fastness of
Bush Mountain, having spent many of the idle
days of his boyhood in roaming over it, and
now it was a favorite refuge when he wished to
think out his sermons, or to wrestle in prayer
over some wayward soul gone astray.  It was
a fair sight to look down on Laurel Cove from
the heights, and see its freshly plowed fields
and blossoming orchards.  The settlers in that
fertile region were more industrious and thrifty
than their neighbors over the mountains, and
they were unusually quiet and law-abiding.
Very few moonshiners were to be found in
Laurel Cove, and not a distillery.  Those were
hidden in remote and secret places on the
mountains.  Let it be said to the enlightenment
of Sile Ed'ards, that he was bold enough
to preach against the making of illicit whiskey,
as against all manner of evil, and many listened
and heeded his words.  But while he climbed
the heights that day, seeking solitude and
God, in Laurel Cove things were going very wrong.

It was past the noon hour, and at the Hardings
all evidences of the midday meal had been
cleaned away.  The boys had gone back to the
fields, Mrs. Harding raked the garden beds
preparatory to seed sowing, and Sarah Betsy
had returned to her weaving.  She had been
through a trying interview with her mother,
listening to scolding and reproaches in silence,
and promising only one thing; to wait awhile
before seeing John Hurd again.

"I can't promise *never* to see him ag'in," she
said, half in tears.

"I don't, fer the life o' me, understan' how
you could 'a' tuk such a fancy to him, when
there's plenty o' better-lookin', pearter boys
for you to 'a' liked," exclaimed Mrs. Harding,
despairingly.

"I've never seen the man he couldn't equal,"
Sarah Betsy murmured; and with a shake of
her head Mrs. Harding went away.

Sarah Betsy was thinking it all over as she
stood by the loom, putting a quill of thread in
the shuttle, when a shadow fell athwart the
door and a man's voice, softened and eager,
exclaimed:

"Sarah Betsy, Sarah Betsy!"

She turned quickly, troubled joy breaking
through the enforced stillness of her face; but
she did not speak.  The young man boldly
entered.

"I 'lowed I must come to see you before I
left the Cove," he said, in explanation and
apology for his untimely visit.

"Air you goin' away, John?" Sarah Betsy
asked, and laid the shuttle down for fear it
would slip through her trembling fingers.

"Yes."

"Why?  Where do you think o' goin'?"

"Over on Bush Mountain, to work in Aaron
Brown's 'stillery," he said, answering her last
question first.

"Don't do that!" the girl cried, in dismay.
"Oh, please don't do that!  Think how the
revenue men has watched it; an' once, don't
you know? they tuk the Brown boys off to jail."

"I don't keer," he muttered, sullenly.  "Pa
an' me's had a fallin' out.  He lows we'll never
marry if he can help it, an' I 'low we will."  He
crossed the floor and laid his hands gently on
her shoulders.  "Let 'em do an' say what they
will, they can't come between us, honey, can
they?" his voice sinking to a softer, tenderer key.

"I didn't 'low they'd keer so much," Sarah
Betsy faltered, with downcast eyes, in which
hot tears were swimming.

"You er not thinkin' o' goin' back on yer
word to me, air you?" Hurd exclaimed, his
face darkening.

"We must wait, John—we must wait."

"Yes, tel I can git a start," in a relieved
tone.

"Tel my ma an' your pa air willin'," she
said, taking up the shuttle.

"I care more for you th'n for what they may
say, an' I 'lowed you did the same, or you
wouldn't 'a' promised to marry me.  I s'pose
you didn't mean it."

"I did mean it; but it's more'n I can do to
go ag'in' 'em so p'intedly all at once," she said,
and turned from him to lean against the loom,
love and duty struggling mightily together in
her heart.

"Well, it ain't more'n I can do," he replied,
grimly; "an' when I get settled I'm jest bound
to keep you to yer promise."

He drew nearer to her, hesitated, then
kissed her cheek.

"I love you Sarah Betsy—I love you,
honey," he whispered, then turned quickly
away.

She followed him to the door, and when he
had disappeared from her sight she looked
long and gravely at Bush Mountain, a vast
pile rising against the sky, its rugged slopes
softened by a hazy veil.  It had been invested
with new interest for her as the temporary
home and refuge of her lover.

The outbreak of the old feud between the
Hurds and the Hardings was soon known
throughout the Cove, and discussed at every
fireside.  Bitter feelings were engendered
between sympathizing friends of the two families,
and the peaceful settlement was divided into
factions.  The Harding boys were too young
to take much part in the wordy war, but
Mrs. Harding did not lack chivalrous support from
some of her neighbors, who loudly declared
that no lone woman should be trampled upon.
The women, at least the younger women, and
those inclined to sentiment, expressed great
sympathy for Sarah Betsy and John.  It seemed
hard that the lovers should be divided by a
quarrel between the elder members of the
families.

"It's best for 'em if they only knowed it,"
said one brown, withered old woman, shaking
her head grimly and cynically over her pipe.
"Neither life nor men air what we 'low they
air, when we er young.  These young fo'ks air
separated while their love is warm an' frush,
an' without discoverin' that it ain't goin' to last
ferever, an' that no human creetur is without a
mighty load o' faults.  I can recollect more'n
one couple that 'peared lack they'd die
broken-hearted if they didn't git married, an' then in a
little while, 'peared lack they'd die because
they wus married.  There ain't no countin' on
human natur, I can tell you.  It's about the
oncertaintest thing in this world 'ceptin' death."

Sile Ed'ards had to learn a new lesson in
this uncertain human nature that summer,
when those who in former times seemed to
care most for his counsel turned impatiently
away from his entreaties for peace.  His words
fell to the ground, and he carried a sorely
troubled and heavy heart about with him, and
spent more time than ever in the solitude of
Bush Mountain, fasting and praying for his
erring flock, who seemed to enjoy the excitement
of a quarrel far more than they did the peaceable
worship of the Lord; who brought sounds
of strife to the very altar rails, more than one
meeting having ended in bitter words.

The material prosperity of Laurel Cove was
not in the least affected by the evil spirit
apparently ruling the people.  The corn-fields
promised an abundant harvest, and the
orchards were rich in fruits.

Mrs. Harding was an industrious woman,
toiling early and late, and her hours of repose
were, in the main, peaceful, though she rose
sometimes in the middle of the night and crept
softly to Sarah Betsy's bed to see that she
also slept; for her heart yearned secretly over
this disobedient daughter who had lost her
bright, cheerful ways since John Hurd went
away from the Cove.  She suffered almost as
much as the girl, though they said little to
each other about it.  Once Mrs. Harding did
attempt to reason with Sarah Betsy, but she
turned and said:

"Didn't you love Pa?"

"Didn't I?  There wusn't many men to
equal your pa."

"In your eyes, Ma, but maybe not in the
eyes o' them what didn't love him.  Love
makes a mighty difference in the way we look
at fo'ks.  I 'low ever' woman thinks the man
she loves is the best in the world."

Her mother said no more; but she ceased
not to muse on the mystery and power of love.
One morning she had started to the cow lot
with a milk pail on her arm, when she saw a
woman coming slowly through the sparse timber
in the rear of the barn, a sunbonnet pulled
closely over her head and face.  It was very
early.  Deep Cimmerian shadows still obscured
the low country, though the crimson light
of dawn was spreading upward from the east,
and a fading spectral moon sank slowly
behind the western mountains.  The morning
star hung over the crest of Bush Mountain,
heralding the day, and fine elusive
mists rolled away from the Cove into
the hollows and ravines of the guarding ranges.

A ghostly stillness seemed to hang over the
world, and Mrs. Harding could hear the
dry twigs crackling sharply under the feet
of the slowly approaching woman.  She
went on into the lot and poured some bran
and peas into the feeding-trough, and softly
called the cow, standing in a distant corner.
The stranger walked timidly up to the bars,
and pushed back her sunbonnet.  She was a
small, meek-faced old woman, withered and gray.

"Good-mornin', Mis' Harding."

Mrs. Harding stiffened rigidly, and stared
coldly at her, not recognizing her until she
had spoken.

"You air out early, Mis' Hurd."

"Yes.  I don't know what Hurd would do
or say, if he knowed it; but he started to mill
'fore daylight, an' I crope out, 'lowin' it 'ud be
a good time fer seein' you."  She paused,
absently untied her bonnet-strings, passed a
trembling hand over her gray hair, then looked
wistfully at Mrs. Harding.

"Mis' Harding, has Sarah Betsy heard
anything from John lately?"

"Heard from John!" with a flash of indignation.
"Didn't I tell Mister Hurd you needn't
be a pest'rin' 'bout Sarah Betsy?  It 'pears to
me—"

"It's all 'long o' me bein' so troubled about
him that I asked," said the old woman, hastily.
"One o' the Brown boys wus down in the
Cove t'other day an' he 'lowed John was sick,
an' yesterday I begged his pa to go over there
an' see 'bout him, but he 'lowed it wusn't no
use; if John thought he could take keer o'
hisself, let him do it.  Men fo'ks, Mis' Harding,
hain't got the feelin's o' women.  There is such
a weight here," laying one hard, withered
hand on her breast, "that sometimes it 'pears
to me I can't git my breath.  If he hadn't
a-gone off to the 'stillery.  Them revenue officers
will git him, shore, an' he'll die in jail; for he
never could bear to be shut up.  Why, he
always sleeps with the door o' his room open.
I hain't got nothin' ag'in' Sarah Betsy, Mis'
Harding.  I'd much ruther John an' her would
marry th'n fer him to go off."

Her shrunken lips trembled piteously; some
large tears rolled down her face.  The frigidness
of Mrs. Harding's attitude relaxed.  She
moved nearer the bars.

"I hain't nothin' ag'in' John, either, but
Mister Hurd—"

"Is terribly sot in his ways, I know; but he
don't mean to do wrong.  He jest thinks he
knows what is best for ever'body," said
Mrs. Hurd, loyally.  "John was always the sweetest,
lovin'est child," returning to the subject
absorbing her, "an' he never wus one to stay away
from home much, even when he'd growed up.
I never keered fer no better comp'ny than his'n;
an' if a good son makes a good husband, then
any girl might be proud to git him.  It's
turrible lonesome 'thout him ever comin' in or
goin' out.  Hurd says nothin' 'bout it, an'
'pears to sleep like a log; but I'm pestered at
all hours o' the night, an' git up to look in
John's room, an' when I see the bed all white
an' smooth I feel like he's dead."

The cow ate up her food and went browsing
along the fence corners again.  Mrs. Harding's
heart waxed soft within her.  What
religion failed to do, human sympathy
accomplished.  By her own experiences of
motherhood she could understand the yearning and
heartache of this other woman.  It created a
bond between them far easier of comprehension
to her than the spiritual tie the preacher
talked about.  That seemed a mere cold
abstraction—this a warm, living thing.

"I'm real sorry Sarah Betsy hain't heard
nothin' from him," she said softly.

"I 'lowed maybe she would.  Well, well, I
won't pester you any longer."

Involuntarily their hands met through the
bars in a quick close grip.

"I'm in hopes there ain't no bad news
a-waitin' fer you, Mis' Hurd."

"I hope so; but a scritch owl lit nigh the
door last night an' wouldn't hardly be driv' off,
an' that's a bad sign, you know," she said
mournfully, and turned to retrace her steps
along the path through the woods, the dawn
shining fair upon her bent gray head and slight
figure.  Mrs. Harding stood by the bars and
watched her with a mingling of perplexity and
compassion.  She heard the voices of her own
sons at the house, and sighed.

"It 'ud go mighty hard with me if they wus
tuk away.  I hain't nothin' ag'in' Mis' Hurd nor
John, but old Killus would rile the angel
Gabr'el hisself."  She finally stooped and picked
up her milk pail.  "It ain't fer me to fergit my
pride an' be crowed over by him."

Mrs. Hurd went on her way home.  As she
passed through a laurel brake, absorbed in her
sad thoughts, she came face to face with Sile
Ed'ards.  He looked worn and hollow-eyed,
as though he, too, had passed through sleepless
nights and troubled days; but she was too
preoccupied to be very observant.  A minister
must ever be ready to comfort and counsel
his flock, no matter what his own feelings may
be, so Mrs. Hurd poured out the story of her
anxiety, and Ed'ards said what he could to
reassure her.

"I'm goin' up to Bush Mountain, an' I'll see
if I can hear anything o' John for you," he said
kindly.

He did not tell her that he would see the
young man and talk with him, but that was
what he purposed doing as he slowly climbed
the great mountain.  He spent the morning in
visiting one or two of his parishioners who
lived on the mountain, then went on his way
to Aaron Brown's house, a low cabin near the
summit of the peak.  There he learned that
John Hurd had returned to work again, but
Mrs. Brown shook her head over the state of
his health.

"He's peaked, an' ain't got no appetite, an'
I tell Brown it's all 'long o' his frettin' 'bout the
quarrel with his pa an' the fo'ks in the Cove.
He ain't fittin' fer the 'stillery work, nuther.
It don't agree with him to al'ays have to be
on the watch an' ready to run if a twig snaps,
or a breath rustles the leaves."  She sighed.
"My old man an' the boys don't keer.  Brown
is as cunnin' as the fox that's had experience
hidin' from the hounds, an' he's brought up the
boys to be like him.  Come back an' spend
the night," she called after the preacher when
he started on.  "You ain't fittin' to be takin'
such walks as this, nohow."

He winced, her blunt speech, the pitying
glance she gave him, touching his pride.
Nevertheless he accepted her invitation, then
pressed onward toward the still, following a
narrow trail down into a wild ravine.  Night
had fallen, and the deepest solitude surrounded
Ed'ards, but he felt no fear.  Now and
then a gleam of starlight shone across his way,
or rustling leaves betrayed the presence of
animals abroad for prey.  The distillery was
located in an excavation under a ledge of rock,
the upper entrance only a hole an ordinary
sized man could crawl through, and cunningly
concealed by a network of laurel, the lower
one away down where a little stream trickled
out between the roots of a gnarled old tree.
Nature had helped the mountaineer to evade
the law in giving him such places of concealment.

Ed'ards approached the spot with that
caution inherent in almost all the people of that
region, no matter what their calling may be.
He was within a few yards of the opening of
the still when he ran into the very arms of a
man, and felt himself surrounded by a party,
although it was too dark to see anything
distinctly.  He could not tell whether they were
friends or foes in that first moment, but instinct
warned him to still be cautious.

"Ha! we have caught one of them," muttered
a voice, and then he knew that he was in
the hands of the revenue officers.

Who shall say what thoughts passed through
his mind in that moment?  He could proclaim
his vocation, purchase his own release by
pointing out the hiding-place of the moonshiners,
could send John Hurd away to prison.
He stood still and speechless in the midst of
the party.

"The 'stillery is not far away," said one.

"Hush," said another, warningly; "perhaps
this fellow's friends are lurking near."

"They are," cried Ed'ards, and broke
through the group so swiftly, so unexpectedly
that he fairly slipped from their hands, free.

He stumbled pantingly over stones and
underbrush, lost his stick, and then crawled
along the ground, shouting at the top of his
voice to those in the underground workroom.
The officers Came thrashing through the brush
after him, and he felt the sting of a bullet as it
entered his side.  They had fired several shots,
and one had been correctly aimed in spite of
the darkness.  He fell across the mouth of the
cave just as those within fled down the
passageway and out into the woods beyond.

Laurel Cove was shaken from center to
circumference by the tragical death of the
preacher.  That he, the most innocent and
God-fearing man in the community, should die
like a common outlaw, seemed the crudest,
unjustest trick of fate.  But deep in the
consciousness of the sober-minded lurked the
thought that he had been sacrificed by his own
people; that the revenue officers were less to
blame than his parishioners.  It was old
Killus Hurd who had the courage to acknowledge
this feeling the day Sile Ed'ards was buried.
It transpired that he had also gone to the
'stillery that day; that he fled with his son
and the others when that warning cry, those
pistol shots, came.  He assumed all the blame,
for had he not quarreled with the Hardings
and then with his son?—but it was over.
Peace should henceforth reign in his own
household and in the household of his neighbor.
He said this holding out his hand to
Mrs. Harding, and weepingly she took it, for she
also felt conscience-smitten for what had
happened.  The younger people were happier,
for youth cannot feel as the sober middle-aged,
and they were once more together.  Sarah
Betsy never knew that Ed'ards had loved her,
but secretly cherished his memory with tender
gratitude for being the means of giving back
her lover to her.

But while they extolled his virtues and
grieved for his sad fate, making peace with
each other as they heaped the moist earth upon
his grave, who shall say that his glad spirit
was not soaring away to realms where neither
infirmity of body nor sorrow of heart dwells?

   THE CRUCIAL TEST.

.. vspace:: 2

It was down on the Altamaha.  The
Dugarres always spent the summers in their large,
old-fashioned mansion, on their own plantation,
coming out from Savannah in May and returning
in November.  It was a picturesque house,
with its wide halls, its piazzas, and its white
columns that a man's arms could not reach
more than half around.  It had withstood the
changes of time, and war, and the passing away
of several generations.  It was a landmark of
the old South, and though the row of cabins in
the rear still had a few dusky occupants, they
were farm-laborers, hired to work by the day.

The Dugarres were famous for their hospitality,
and entertained guests from all parts of
the Union.  An unusually large party lounged
on the shady piazza one hot, languid summer
afternoon, representing Charleston, Atlanta,
and even New York, not to speak of the fair
Savannahians, and of Valentine Dugarre, all
the way from Brazil.  It was too warm for
exertion; all quiet amusements had flagged, and
even conversation had become a stupid effort,
when Edward Dugarre brought out a dusty old
*Century* and read Stedman's poem "Hebe."  It
roused both the lazy and the meditative to
lively comments, all agreeing in their
condemnation of Fiorina's revenge, so summary
and so terrible.  Did I say all?  There was
one exception—Valentine Dugarre.  But some
of them looked upon her as half savage,
because of her Brazilian birth and her perfectly
frank way of speaking out her thoughts and
feelings.  The Dugarres themselves were half
afraid of her and rejoiced when she became
engaged to Frank Black, a handsome young
Savannahian of good family but of rather weak,
unstable nature.  She had been sent up to
them to have an American finish put to her
education and manners; but alien blood flowed
in her veins, and she had been worshiped and
spoiled in her own home until she had become
as imperious and exacting as princesses are
supposed to be.  She could do the rashest,
most unheard-of things when enraged, or when
in a generous mood—such, for instance, as
taking a ring from her finger and giving it to a
ragged beggar when he asked her for five cents.
When scolded for it by her shocked aunt she
impatiently exclaimed:

"Can't you see that he is starving?  What
real need have I for the thing?  Let it go, if
it can be the means of bringing him food and
clothing.  I do not care to be rich, to wear
jewels, while others are perishing with hunger."

And that summer afternoon she sat among
those people, listening in silence to all their
comments, and waiting until the last to have
her say about the matter.

She was an imperial-looking girl, dark, but
with a faint, delicate bloom on her cheeks, and
the color of a rose on her lips.  Her eyes were
not black but golden-brown, and her hair had
the texture of silk.  Her very dress seemed to
set her apart from the other women, who
clothed themselves according to the decrees of
fashion.  It was fine-woven yellow linen, its
full loose folds girdled in about the waist with
a broad band of silver, its sleeves open half
way up, revealing beautiful rounded arms.  She
set at open defiance all forms and rules, and
laughed contemptuously at the conventionalities
of society.

"I quite approve of Fiorina's revenge," she
said at last, "only I would have killed the
woman also;" then she smiled with scornful
contempt to see the blood forsaking Helen
Lawrence's face.  "Why do you turn pale,
Miss Lawrence?" she asked, leaning toward
her with a gleam of mockery in her eyes.

"I—because it is horrible to hear you talk
so," said Miss Lawrence, quickly recovering
herself, for she shrank, if Valentine did not,
from a crossing of words, as it was known by
all in the house that the young Brazilian was
jealous of her.

"Val does not mean it," said Edward,
soothingly.

"I do mean it.  What right had she to come
between them—to use all her smooth little
ways and arts to make him faithless?  Yes,
by all means, Hebe should have feasted upon
her first."

She glanced at her lover, but he was looking
intently across the sunlit cotton-fields to the
shining sweep of the river, apparently not in
the least interested in the conversation.  Then
she looked around on the disapproving faces
of the other women.

"You may all look shocked, but I am
different from you only in the expression of my
thoughts.  There is an untamed savage in
every heart, no matter how finely the owner
of that heart may be civilized, how highly polished."

"There is also a spirit of divinity, Miss
Dugarre," said Mark Livingston, the young
Charleston lawyer, in his grave, calm voice.

"But in some unguarded moment, some
crisis, the savage conquers all.  It is easy to be
good until one is deceived or thwarted."

"But what cause have you to talk like a
disappointed, soured woman of the world,
Valentine?" her cousin exclaimed, a little
impatiently.

"Oh, none whatever, of course."  But a note
of bitterness thrilled her sweet voice, and her
jealous eyes saw the glance Helen Lawrence
exchanged with Frank Black.  She bit her full
under-lip, until the blood almost started.

"You believe, then, that the evil in human
nature is stronger than the good?" said Livingston.

"I do; for is it not true that many a lifetime
of noble deeds has been wrecked in a moment
of passion, the man stripped of his goodness,
as of a garment, leaving the naked savage,
fierce, revengeful?"

"But if there are such instances, so we can
as easily recall others, where men and women,
in moments of supreme sorrow or danger,
have so far risen above all personal feeling as
to be willing, nay, eager, to help their worst
enemies."

She turned to her lover, "What do you
think, Frank?"

"That it is too warm for argument, and
that Ed might have selected less tragical
reading for our amusement."

He laughed a little as he spoke, to give a
jesting turn to his words, and, rising, walked
away into the hall.  Valentine's eyes flashed
with anger, but in a moment she rose and
followed him into the cool, duskily shadowed
library.

"Dearest, did I disgust you with my savage talk?"

"I do not like such sentiments from you,
Valentine.  It does not sound womanly, and
those people criticise you severely enough
as it is."

Her eyes darkened again; her lips curled.

"What do I care for their good opinion!"

"It is well for us to care for everybody's
good opinion."

"Miss Lawrence has taught you that great
and noble truth, has she?  You have grown
very critical of my speech and manners
yourself since she came among us.  Frank,
Frank! what is it coming between us?" she cried, in
sudden, piteous entreaty.

"Your jealous imagination, Valentine.  A
man does not like to be doubted, frowned
upon, every time he speaks to, or looks at,
another woman."

"Is that all?  Tell me, on your honor."

"Yes," he said; but his eyes shifted under
her eager gaze, and a slight flush rose to his
face.  But she was too anxious to believe him
to heed such fine changes of expression.

"I *am* a miserable, jealous creature, all fire
and wicked temper," she humbly acknowledged.
"I have tormented you, I know; but
unfortunately for me I love you with all my
heart, instead of just a little bit of it, and it
is a great strong heart, dearest, if it is
wayward and untamed."

She leaned toward him with luminous eyes,
her beauty softened, as sweet and gentle as
that of any other woman.  What man could
resist her in such a mood?  He raised her
arms to his neck, and kissed her on lips and
eyes.

"You love me, you do really love me?"
she whispered.

"Love you!  How can I help it, my princess?"

They had a little dance at Dugarre that
night—a merry, informal party.  A large
number of young people came out from the
neighboring town, the parlors were cleared,
and Uncle 'Riah, the old white-haired fiddler,
was called in to play for them.  It was a
moonless night, and to add a little to the
picturesqueness of the fine old house and grounds
the negroes built a great bonfire on the lawn.
It threw its ruddy light afar under the trees,
and a rain of glowing sparks fell here and there
on the grass, and some even floated away on
wreaths of pearly smoke over the roofs.

The ladies of the house were all in evening
dress, but it was acknowledged that Valentine
Dugarre and Helen Lawrence carried off the
palm for beauty.  Valentine appeared her
loveliest and best.  No suggestion of scorn or anger
marred her face.  Her dress of thin, creamy
silk was Greek-like in its flowing lines and its
full draperies, and her throat and arms were
bare.  She wore no jewels, except her
engagement ring, and a single diamond star in her
hair.  She was radiant, yet so sweet and gentle
in all her ways, that those who thought they
knew her best wondered what new whim
possessed her.  She even smiled approval when
Black led Helen out on the floor and danced
with her.  If he had stopped at that!—but
he asked her after the dance to walk on the
piazza with him.  She hesitated, cast a
hurried glance about the room, saw Valentine in a
distant corner talking to Livingston, and consented.

They walked the length of the long piazza,
and then Black drew Helen into the deserted
library.  She took her hand from his arm, her
usually pale face burning with color, her calm
eyes agitated.  It was enough to set his
faithless heart aflame—to call forth treasonable
words of love.  Curiously enough it was on the
very spot where a few hours before he had
given Valentine such assurance of his love.
The remembrance stung him to shame, but it
could not silence his tongue.  His love for
Valentine had been an infatuation, but Helen
held his heart.  So he told himself, so he had
been telling himself for a month, though he
had never before confessed as much to Helen.
Valentine was not the woman to make him
happy, with her jealous, tempestuous moods
and passionate temper.

"But you, you are an angel of sweetness and
goodness," he said, kissing her hands, even
the folds of her pale-blue silken sleeves.

Helen shivered a little as she listened to
him, and cast uneasy glances about the room,
for there was a good deal of cowardice in her
nature, and she feared Valentine.

"What if she should hear you?" she said,
trembling, yet leading him on with her soft
eyes, her half-yielding manner.

"Why speak of her, think of her, now?"
he exclaimed, "My bondage is not yet
hopeless, and I—I cannot help not loving her."

"But you are engaged to her, and it is all
wrong to talk so to me," she said, tears
starting suddenly to her eyes.  What she had
deliberately begun as a flirtation had become as
serious to her as to him.  Her emotion nearly
distracted him.  Still rasher words trembled
on his lips, when—

"Is this tableau for the benefit of the
public, or only for your own amusement?" a voice
inquired near them, causing them to start
guiltily apart, for it was Valentine herself
standing there, white as her dress, and with eyes
that were terrible in their rage and anguish.
"Mr. Black will be perfect in the art of
love-making if he continues his present role.  You
need not tremble and look as if you'd like to
run away, Miss Lawrence.  There is no Hebe
here to crunch your delicate bones, richly as
you deserve such a fate, and willingly as I
would give you to it."

"Blame me for it all, Valentine, not her,"
exclaimed Black, feeling like a craven between
them.

"So you would protect and defend her!
What a chivalrous gentleman! what a man of
honor!  Do you think I have been blind and
deaf to the sighs and glances, to the thousand
little arts she has used upon you—she, the
example that has been held up to me by my
aunt as worthy of imitation?  Well, I
congratulate her on the conquest she has made.
Two months ago you were ready to grovel at
my feet, and to-day—yes, only a few hours
ago—you assured me that you were true, that
you loved me; and I believed you."  Her
passion rose again to violence.  "I would like
to kill you both; yes, with my own hands!"

"Hush, for Heaven's sake!" exclaimed
Black.  "Do you want all those people in here?"

"Oh, no!  It doesn't, of course, make any
difference if you break my heart, but it would
be shocking for the world to know it.  I will
hush, and leave you to console and reassure
Miss Lawrence; but do not expect me to break
our engagement.  You shall never be free
until I die—never!"

And then she left them, disappearing through
the open window as swiftly and noiselessly as
she had come upon them.  Livingston met
her on the piazza, and, without questioning his
presence there, she allowed him to take her
hand and lead her to a seat.  He looked almost
as pale as she, and far more agitated, and when
she turned from him, covering her face with
her hands, his self-possession deserted him
entirely.

"Don't—don't cry, Valentine.  He is not
worth a tear, or one pang of that dear heart of
yours."

"I know his worth; but that cannot alter my
feelings now.  I love him."

"And I—I love you, Valentine, even as you
love him."

Valentine turned and looked at Livingston.

"Then I pity you," she said, simply, but
with such pathos that he himself felt like
dealing out summary punishment to Black.  He
did not attempt to plead his own cause then,
knowing that it would be not only selfish but
worse than useless.  She had no thought for
him or for anybody or anything but her own
sorrow and bitterness.  "I wonder if animals
can have souls, because if they do I must have
been a tigress."

She laughed tremulously, crushing up folds
of her gown in her hands.  "I'd like to kill
them, I would indeed!" she exclaimed, her
eyes burning through a veil of tears.

"You think so now because you are excited,"
Livingston said gently, as though speaking to
an angry child.

"Excited!  I think I must be mad."

"You could not do them any violence, Valentine,
were it really in your power.  I know
your generous, noble nature better than that."

But she turned away again, with hidden face,
jealous rage melting into anguish.

Nobody could ever tell just how it happened.
The most reasonable theory was that it caught
from some of those vagrant sparks flying up
from the bonfire, but deep in the darkness and
silence of that night, long after the household
had all retired, a little tongue of fire shot up
from the roof, growing larger and brighter until
its light shone across the woods and fields
beyond the river.

It was Valentine who, turning on her pillow
to look from the window, saw the strange
illumination, and, springing up, discovered its
cause.  One could hear the curl and crackle of
the dry boards as the flames devoured them,
feel the heat, smell the rolling volumes of
smoke.  Confusion reigned supreme as
Valentine ran through the halls, waking the
slumbering people.  Nobody attempted to save
anything, but all fled for their lives from the
old house, which burned like so much tinder.
The great trees surrounding it were shriveled
in the heat, and falling flakes of fire set barns
and stables ablaze.  The low clouds caught
the lurid reflection, the river shone like a
mirror, while along the horizon the darkness was
so intense, so thick and inky black, that it
seemed as if all the night had been
compressed into it.

The Dugarres wept to see the old house
falling to ashes before their eyes—all but
Valentine.  Its walls held no loving associations, no
precious memories for her; but the force, the
awful destructive fury of the fire fascinated her.

And then, from group to group, ran a cry
for Miss Lawrence.  She could not be found.
Had she been left, forgotten in the terror and
confusion?  Then, indeed, men and women
looked at one another with blanched faces and
eyes of horror.

"It would be death to go in there now," said
one man.

But, death or not, one had gone, running
across the lawn, up the steps, and into the
clouds of smoke filling the piazza and
wreathing the great white columns—Valentine
Dugarre.  Black and Livingston would have
followed her, but were forcibly restrained.  It was
enough, they were told, that two lives should
be lost, without throwing their own away.  But
in a few moments a joyful shout drew all to the
side of the house, where they saw Valentine at
a second-story window, with Helen Lawrence
half-fainting at her side.  She helped her
through the window, and those below could
hear her eager words of encouragement as
Helen dropped safely down to the hands
outstretched to receive her.

"Now, Valentine! quickly, dear!" cried her
cousin, sharply.

"Yes, for God's sake!" Livingston cried.
But it was too late.  A volume of flame seemed
to burst up at her very feet, curling in the folds
of her white gown and circling about her head.
Ont of that fiery nimbus her face shone for a
moment, and then, with a creaking of burning
timbers and a great flare of light, the whole
building fell in.

   THE STORY OF A LILAC GOWN.

.. vspace:: 2

It was my grandaunt, Euphemia D'Esterre's
gown; and when my mother said that I must
wear it to the fancy-dress party, superstitious
terror thrilled through me.  It lay in an old
chest, under a heterogeneous collection of
D'Esterre relics, and was a peculiarly soft, sheeny
lilac silk, made in a quaint fashion, with a
slender, pointed bodice, puffed shoulders, and a full,
straight skirt.  Frills of fine yellow old lace
finished off the low neck and short sleeves, and
a faint, exquisite perfume lingered in its
delicate, shimmering folds.  A portrait of my
grandaunt—painted in that very lilac gown by some
long-forgotten New Orleans artist—hung over
our sitting-room mantel, and many a time I
stood before it, brooding over the mystery
enshrouding the final fate of the original.

It was a beautiful picture of a beautiful young
woman, with radiant blue-gray eyes, golden
hair rolled high on her proudly poised head,
and lips ready to curve in happy laughter.  A
cluster of cream-white roses drooped against
her bosom, and a string of pearls encircled her
full, white throat, A curious sympathy
seemed to exist between me and this fair
kinswoman, who had lived, loved, and passed from the
earth long before my birth.  She had been a
belle and beauty in the days when the D'Esterres
were rich, with plantations on Red River
and a winter home in New Orleans.  She
was the flower of the family, her father's
favorite, and he had promised her in marriage to
one of the wealthiest planters in Louisiana,
when he discovered that she had fallen deeply
in love with a young man he had employed as
overseer—a handsome, cultivated, but poor
young German.  There were scenes and
violent words, but Euphemia firmly refused to
give up her lover until he was proven guilty
of the theft of a large sum of money from her
father.  It was a terrible blow to her, but more
terrible still was an account of his death a few
weeks after he sailed away to the West Indies.
He had died of yellow fever.

She fell into a state of the deepest melancholy;
and, being a devout Catholic, entreated
to be allowed to enter a convent and spend
the remainder of her life in pious works; but
her family refused.  They permitted her to
convert the dressing-room attached to her
bedroom into an oratory, and, wisely or unwisely,
left her alone for a season to indulge her grief,
to pray for the soul of her departed lover, and
to find healing for her own wounded heart.
Then they sought to draw her back into the
world again; the wealthy suitor reappeared,
and, wearied by arguments and entreaties, she
promised to marry him.

The wedding was to take place on the
plantation, and many guests were bidden, and a
great feast prepared.

On her wedding-eve Euphemia came down
clothed in the lilac gown, cream-white roses
on her breast, and the string of pearls around
her fair throat.  Her family were puzzled and
indignant, for that gown somehow seemed
linked with the memory of her sweetheart, who
had died in disgrace.  It was a strange whim
to wear it the night before her marriage.  But
the evening passed merrily enough, and at
eleven o'clock the bedroom candles were
lighted, and she went up the stairs to her room
with a smile on her lips, the lilac gown felling
around her in soft, shimmering folds.

It was the last time family, lover or friends
ever looked upon Euphemia D'Esterre.  The
next morning her room was empty.  The pearls
lay on the dressing-table with the withered
roses, and the lilac gown hung over the back
of a chair; but bride, bridal-gown and veil
were gone.  They looked into the oratory,
thinking that she had gone in there to breathe
her last virginal prayer before the simple altar,
where she had knelt so many times; but the
light shining dimly through the narrow, veiled
window, revealed the sacred place silent,
untenanted.  They sought her everywhere; they
spent money lavishly, but to no purpose.  She
had vanished forever.

Time and the fortunes of war had wrought
many changes in the D'Esterre family.  My
mother, a pale, melancholy young widow, and
I—another Euphemia D'Esterre—and Uncle
Peter were the last of the family.  And we had
drifted away from Louisiana to an old mansion
on the Chattahoochee, in Middle Georgia.
Across the river lay the idle, sleepy old town
of Magnoliaville, with its shady streets,
ivy-covered churches, and inn, rarely visited by a
traveler and stranger.

We had some old silver, my grandaunt's
picture, the pearls, and the lilac gown.  These
were all the real treasures we had gathered
from the wreck of family fortunes; and Uncle
Peter was the last living link between us and
the past.  He was a very old man, his black
face shriveled into a network of wrinkles, his
shoulders bent, his head white, almost, as snow.
He possessed great pride and dignity.  His
long life had been spent in the services of the
D'Esterres, and he refused to leave them when
freedom was proclaimed.

"Tu late fo' dat now.  I praise de Lawd I
gwine die a free man, but I b'long dis fambly
tu long tu leave 'em now.  Let all go dat feels
lack dey wanter, ole Peter gwine stay tel 'e
dies; yes, tel 'e dies."

And he did stay, and was the favorite
playfellow and companion of my childhood.

"Yo's de las', Miss Phemy, honey, de las' o'
dem all, and yo's nuff lack Miss Euphemy tu
'a' been 'er twin.  Lawd, but dis is er mighty
strange worl'—mighty strange," he would often
say, shaking his white head.  He seemed to
feel a certain responsibility and care toward
me as the last of the family.

He lived in the little cabin at the foot of the
garden, provided for out of our slender income
and exempted from all labor; but he insisted
on regarding himself as our servant, weeded the
garden, or sat in the wide, bare hall, ready to
meet chance visitors and usher them into the
barer parlor with old-time ceremony.

To me a halo of romance surrounded his
venerable head.  Such stories as he could tell
me of the past!  They were highly colored
and delightfully exaggerated.  My mother,
absorbed in melancholy retrospection, left me
much to my own devices, and many an evening
I spent in Uncle Peter's cabin, listening to his
rambling talk, and questioning him about my
ill-fated grandaunt.  Nearly all that I had ever
learned of her history had been gleaned from
his conversations.  He would sit at the corner
of the hearth, bent forward in his chair, his
wrinkled old hands folded on the knob of his
walking stick, the firelight playing in
uncertain, flickering gleams over his black face
and kinky white locks.  He was a fair type
of the old-fashioned plantation negro,
simple, superstitious, but shrewd and faithful to
his trusts.  Of Euphemia D'Esterre he always
spoke with reverential pride, but keeping a
certain guard over himself as though he
possessed some knowledge he did not want to
betray.

"She wus mighty proud, oh yes, honey, dey
all helt dey heads high; but she neber was
hard on de black fo'ks.  She al'ays had er smile,
or kind word for um, tel bimeby she got in dat
trubble, en had no smiles for ennybody.  Ole
marse had jes done gimme tu be Marse Albert's
boy, en I was little; but I seed en hear more'n
ennybody things I does.  I seed 'er comin' down
de stairs dat night in dat laylock gown, en
smilin' so strange lack a chill crope down my
back.  De tables was done spread fo' de
weddin', de cakes backed, de silber shinin', en de
fo'ks all done come.  Hit would 'a' been de
bigges' weddin' eber on Red River ef Miss
Euphemy hadn't tuk en vanished as she did.  Lawd,
Lawd, what did become o' 'er?"

He always came round to that hopeless
question, shaking his head with a deep sigh.  Then,
after a reflective pause, he would cast a glance
over his shoulder into the shadowy corners of
the room, and, lower his voice to a solemn
whisper, say:

"Miss Phemy, honey, I feels lack she gwinter
come back—lack she gwinter 'pear tu ole Peter
'fo' 'e dies."

I had listened to the utterance of that
superstitious belief countless times, but repetition
could not rob it of its impressiveness.  I ceased
to shiver and feel as though my blood was
curdling, but I would cast an awed, half-fearful
glance out into the night, almost expecting to
see her come floating downward through its
solemn gloom, clothed in white raiment,
radiant as the stars.

No wonder a thrill of apprehension chilled
my young blood, when the lilac gown was
suggested as a suitable costume for the first
fancy-dress party I had ever known to be given in
Magnoliaville.

"It is quaint, and lovely, and with the pearls
will be quite charming; and then I have heard
that there are visitors—yes, actually three or
four visitors in Magnoliaville," said my mother,
with a sparkle of animation.

"But I don't want to wear that dress; indeed,
I would rather stay at home than put it on!" I
faltered, ashamed, yet determined to speak out
my fears.

"Why, Phemie!" she exclaimed, in gentle
scorn, "what nonsense!  You are nineteen
years old, and have too few opportunities of
going into the world to give up one for a
childish whim.  I was married at your age," sighing
softly; then her eyes strayed from me to the
picture.  "How strangely you resemble her!
It would really be a fine idea to copy the
picture as closely as possible."

"Oh, mother!" I shuddered: but she chided
me gently, and I had to yield to her wishes.
She superintended my toilet that night, and I
trembled when I looked at myself in the mirror;
for it was not Phemie D'Esterre, the obscure
country girl, but Euphemia D'Esterre, the
Louisiana belle and beauty, reflected before my
startled eyes.  The string of pearls around my
throat and a cluster of white roses completed
the illusion.

Friends were coming over the river for me,
and my mother hastened down stairs to be
ready to meet them, leaving me to follow more
leisurely.  A light burned in the lower hall,
and Uncle Peter sat in his favorite chair dozing.
Did the rustle of my gown disturb him as I
stepped softly from stair to stair?  He moved
uneasily, raised his head, and glancing upward,
saw me.  For a moment he stared vacantly,
his dim old eyes clouded with sleep; but as I
drew nearer a dull, ashy hue overspread his
face—a convulsive trembling seized him.

"Great land! ef dar ain't Miss Euphemy now,
done come at las'!" he muttered, hoarsely.
"Honey, I'se been 'spectin' en lookin' fo' yo'
menny a day.  Dar, dar, don't come tu nigh,"
raising a shaking hand pleadingly.  "I 'spect
I know what yo' come fo'.  Hit's 'bout dem
letters dey tuk, en de way dey treated young
marse 'bout dat money dey made lack 'e stole.
I knowed dar'd be no res' fo' yo' tel yo' foun'
hit all out.  Hit wusn't me, honey.  I neber
done yo' no harum.  Hit was ole Dan'l.  Yo'
'member Dan'l, what waited on ole marse, en
knowed all de comin'-in en goin'-out o' de place?
Hit wus Dan'l ole marse gin dem gold dollars
tu, tu he'p git young marse in trubble, tu spy
on yo', en tu steal de letters what yo' writ 'im.
Oh, yes, yes.  Peter wus mighty young den, des
big ernuff tu wait on Marse Albert; but 'e know
all long how dey wus treatin' yo'.  'E watch
en listen, but 'e 'feered tu speak, en 'e wouldn't
say nuffin arterwards fo' de fambly's sake; 'e
des keep hit all tu 'isse'f."

So there had been fraud and dishonor on the
part of my family, and Uncle Peter had kept
the secret through all his long life.  I was too
confused and agitated by the mistake he had
made in my identity to fully comprehend all
his words at the moment, but later they
returned clearly to me.

"Uncle Peter," I cried, "don't you know me?"

"Yes, yes, honey, ain't I been tellin' yo' hit
wus Dan'l he'ped ole marse break yo' po' heart,
en fix dat money tel fo'ks b'lieve young marse
stole hit.  When dar wus no weddin', kase yo'
done gone whar no man could fine yo', Dan'l
'e 'pented o' 'is sin; 'e fine no res' fo' 'is soul; 'e
take de money what had been gin tu 'im, in
tu ole marse, en lay hit down 'fo' 'im, en sez:

"'I can't keep hit, Marse, hit des burn my
hands, des burn my soul.  I'm gittin' ole, I
gwine die 'fo' menny year, sah, en I can't go tu
de jedgment long o' dat money; en den Miss
Euphemy she des 'pear tu me, en she say:
"Dan'l, Dan'l, what yo' been doin'?  'Pent,
Dan'l, 'pent 'fo' de Lawd's wrath be turned ag'in'
yo'!"  I sees 'er in eber' shadder, hears 'er in
eber' win' dat blows.  She come in de
night-time, en she come in de daytime.  Oh, Marse,
take hit back, fo' de lub o' Gawd, en let me be
de hardes' wuked man on de place, so ez I git
ease o' my trubble.'

"En Dan'l, 'e des brake down, en cry out
loud, de tears a-rollin' frum 'is eyes, en ole
marse groan, en sez:

"'She done gone, Dan'l—she done gone, en
all de 'pentin' in de worl' ain't gwine bring 'er
back, en dar ain't nuffin' 'ud ease my trubble.
De Lawd's wrath be on me, Dan'l—de Lawd's
wrath be on me.  Go, ef wuk gwine do enny
good, but don't come nigh me 'g'in.  I ain't
blamin' yo', Dan'l, but 'pear lack de sight o' yo'
make me feel wus.'

"En Dan'l, 'e tuk en go out, en neber look
on ole marse' face agin.  Dan'l 'e 'pented o' 'is
sin.  'E live by 'isse'f; 'e see ha'nts, en 'e hear
sperits talkin', en 'e wuk all de days o' 'is life.
En ole marse 'e mus 'a' seed ha'nts tu, fo' 'e fine
no res' tel 'e die."

He sunk to his knees before me, his white
head bowed to the floor.

"Trufe what I been tellin' yo', Miss Euphemy,
all trufe.  Now go 'way, honey, go 'way,
en don't ax ole Peter to tell enny more tel 'e
come to die."

I have no words in which to describe the
effect of his confession on my excited mind, and
how I pitied his fear.  I tried to draw near to
him, to convince him of my identity; but he
rose, and retreated before me.

"Honey, I knows yo', I 'member how yo'
come down de stairs dat odder night in dat
laylock gown."

You can easily fancy that I was in no mood
for the party.  My friends were charmed with
my costume.

"And I have a special reason for desiring
you to look your loveliest to-night," said
Mrs. Landsdell, as we made our way down to the
ferry.  "We have a stranger with us."

"A stranger!" I echoed, my thoughts still
running on Uncle Peter and his strange hallucination.

"Yes; Mr. Herman Vandala, from New Orleans.
He arrived only yesterday, to look after
some land an agent had bought for him.  My
dear, he is a splendid fellow, rich, and a pet of
society, but not in the least spoiled.  He came
across the river with us."

We were at the ferry, and in the light of the
boatman's lantern I could see the stranger
leaning on the railing guarding the water's edge.
He was slender, and not above medium height,
and when he threw his cigar into the water, and
turned toward us, a curious sensation,
conviction—I know not which—came over me, that I
had met him before; that his dark, handsome
face, and clear, winning eyes were familiar to
me, I stammered when introduced, and stumbled
so awkwardly when he held out his hand
to assist me into the boat, that my cloak
dropped to the ground.  It was his turn to lose
composure.  He grew very pale, and stared at me
as though I embodied a ghost.

"I beg your pardon," he murmured; my
wraps were restored, and I sank tremblingly to
the seat.

The remarks addressed to me, while crossing
the river, were answered only in monosyllables.
A kind of breathless expectation had seized
upon me.  What would happen next, I
wondered?  As often as I encountered Mr. Vandala's
eyes, I felt the blood rush afresh to my
face.  When we landed, to my relief,
Mrs. Landsdell claimed the stranger as her escort,
leaving me to the care of her husband.  But
the moment an opportunity presented itself,
after we entered the ballroom, Mr. Vandala
came to me.

"Miss D'Esterre, will you promenade with me?"

I accepted his offered arm, and we passed
into the parlor.

"I am anxious to explain my strange
behavior when you dropped your cloak at the
river," he said, in a low tone, his manner full
of repressed excitement.  "You are the perfect
image of an old miniature in my possession,
even to every detail of your dress, and I felt
startled at the sight of you."

I trembled, yet did not feel greatly surprised.

"If I could only see the miniature," I
murmured, hesitatingly.

From an inner breast-pocket he instantly
drew a small faded case, and opened it.

"It is painted on ivory, and belongs to a past
generation; but you—I can hardly believe that
you did not sit for it."

I bent eagerly over it, and saw an exquisitely
painted portrait of my grandaunt, evidently
copied from the picture in our possession.  The
blue-gray eyes smiled into mine, the sweet,
curved lips seemed ready to unclose in
speech.

"Where did you get this picture?" I exclaimed,
eagerly.

"It was found among the private papers of
an old man, who died in the West Indies, many
years ago," Mr. Vandala quietly replied.  "He
was overseer on one of her father's
plantations—accepted the situation
until something better
should present itself—for he was a stranger in
a strange land.  He dared to love her, but her
family violently opposed their marriage, and
succeeded in separating them.  In bitterness of
spirit, he left the country with the stigma of
dishonor upon him."

"Unmerited, unmerited," I said, in a stifled tone.

"Even the girl he loved believed in his
guilt, and in a year or two accepted the suitor
her family approved of."

"Believing him dead," I said quietly.

"But on the eve of her wedding-day
disappeared," Mr. Vandala continued, apparently
not heeding my interruptions.  "It was a
mystery relatives and friends were unable to
solve, for with the picture I found a pile of old
newspapers, filled with accounts of her
disappearance and the hopeless efforts made to
find her.  That portrait has been my
companion since the days of primary schools and
round jackets, going with me through college
and over Europe.  Can you wonder at my
agitation when the original seemed to stand
before me?"

He paused a moment, but I could find no
words in which to answer him.  That odd
feeling of a former acquaintance with him
seemed to be growing upon me.

"It would be interesting to solve the
mystery of her disappearance, even now."

"She died that night," I said firmly.

"Pardon me, how do you know?  Could
she not have entered a convent, or fled to
some large city?"

"She died that night," I repeated; "but
where and how I cannot tell you."

"You seem familiar with her story," bending
to look keenly into my face.

"She was my grandaunt, Euphemia D'Esterre,"
returning his glance.

"And he was my uncle, Herman Vandala."

Euphemia D'Esterre, Herman Vandala!
What strange trick of fate had brought those
two names together again, and under such
changed circumstances?  I, the last representative
of the D'Esterres, dwelt in humble obscurity,
apart from the world, while he had
wealth, position—everything.

"I will sit down," I murmured, faintly.

My hand was quickly drawn to his arm
again, and held closely as he led me to a seat,
while in a kind of dream I heard him say:
"Forgive me.  I knew you must be a descendant
of that family the moment I saw you—heard
your name."

If I am minute in recording all the occurrences
of that evening, it is because every
incident was so vividly impressed upon my
memory; it was, in reality, the beginning of
life for me.  I felt that I had simply existed
before.  I danced and talked, but mechanically.
A spell seemed to be upon me, wrought
by the lilac gown.  At last I slipped away
from the crowd to the white-columned piazza.
A few people were walking up and down its
ample length, and some lovers were sitting in
a remote corner, talking softly.  Dewy roses
brushed my gown as I descended the steps
and strolled idly to the shadow of a large
mimosa tree.  A chair had been placed under
it, and I sank down upon it.  How calm, how
cool the night!  A mocking bird trilled
drowsily in the tree above me, the river flowed
between its low banks with gentle murmur, the
stars shone afar in the depths of the sky.  In
the midst of the silence I heard a clock strike.
I counted eleven strokes; and then, without
warning, the scene suddenly changed from
the starlit lawn to a sleeping-room altogether
unfamiliar to me.  It was luxurious, but
curiously old-fashioned, with delicate blue and
white hangings and quaint furniture.  On a
low couch lay a white satin gown, with a
wedding veil thrown over it.  An empty jewel
case stood carelessly open, and some costly
gifts were scattered about.  Candles, set in
slender silver candlesticks, burned on the
dressing-table.

Subdued sounds of life were borne faintly
up from the lower part of the house, and
through an open window flashed the lights
from negro cabins.  Then I heard footsteps
on the stairs, soft laughter, and a winning
voice said:

"Good-night, Euphemia, good-night, and
sweet dreams visit thee.  We shall pray to the
saints for sunshine on the bride to-morrow."

The room door swung partly open.

"Thank you, Melanie," said a low, clear
voice in reply, and then the speaker entered,
a young, lovely woman, clothed in shimmering
lilac silk, with creamy roses on her breast, and
pearls encircling her white, uncovered throat.

She clasped her hands with a gesture of
passionate, unutterable despair as the door
closed, and in her uplifted eyes the anguish of
death seemed to be mirrored.

"Oh, I cannot go through with this mockery,
this loathed marriage!  Why, why are
they all so blind, so blind?  Hearts cannot be
bought and sold; love is eternal.  Oh, Herman,
Herman, why could you not be worthy
of my love?"

She fell weeping and moaning to the floor,
but quickly rose again.

"I will go to father, I will tell him that I
cannot be married to-morrow; oh, I will open
all my heart to him.  Surely he loves me
more than his pride."

She opened the door and glided noiselessly
into the hall, I an unseen shadow at her side.
She made her way unerringly through the
darkness to the staircase, and down to the
lower passage.  The dining-room door stood
ajar, and in the dimly lighted interior, tables,
spread for the wedding feast, glittered.  She
turned from the sight with a shudder, even
when she passed softly through the room to
another door, standing also ajar.  She paused
before it with her hand pressed upon her
heart, looking into the room beyond.  A
handsome, haughty old man sat by a table
with a small box of papers open under his
hand, while on the other side of the table,
stood a tall negro, black as ebony.  The old
man took a handful of gold from his pocket,
and pushed it across to the servant, saying:

"Here, Daniel, I make you a present of this
for your faithfulness.  Are the papers all here?
Yes, I see.  Herman Vandala has an unpleasant
way of haunting my thoughts to-night;
but I will not regret what has been done—I
will not.  It was the only sure way to separate
them, cruel as it might seem to brand an
innocent man with dishonor.  Pshaw! it served
his presumption right, and some day, when
Euphemia is a happy wife, I will make
restitution.  To-morrow will see the triumph of my
hopes and plans," he said, as though to himself,
He leaned back in his chair, his fine, proud
face softening; but the listener shivered, and
trembled like a leaf, her beautiful face ghastly
pale.  She turned and groped her way across
the room, and up-stairs again, and I—I, who
felt the agony rending her, could only walk at
her side in spirit, not in flesh.

"So they plotted—they deliberately wronged
him, and sent him to his death.  My God! and
I believed him guilty!"

She was calm, but madness shone in her eyes.

"To-morrow," she laughed low and
strangely—"to-morrow I'll be the bride of death.  Oh,
I'll cheat them of their triumph!  Black Pond
will hide the secret of my disappearance, for
not even my father cares to go there, so many
superstitions and dark traditions surround it."

She opened a door, and entered an oratory.
Wax lights burned on a small altar; the incense
of flowers filled the air.  A white cross gleamed
in the dim light, and the pictured faces of saints
looked down from the walls.  The influence of
the place seemed to soften her.

"Mother of Christ, forgive them, and receive
my poor broken spirit.  Intercede for me," she
prayed, falling to her knees on the cushion
before the altar, with clasped hands and head
bowed low.  "I am friendless—friendless here on
earth: death alone can save me.  Pitying Christ,
have mercy.  Thou dost understand."

The light fell around her like a halo.  It
touched the gold of her hair to luminous
brightness, shone on one fair cheek, round uncovered
arm and graceful shoulder, and swept downward
to the floor, where violet shadows lay in
the rich soft folds of her gown.  What
incomparable loveliness to be given to death,
and such a hideous death! but no shrinking, no
regret moved her.  The knowledge of her
father's treachery had decided her.  She rose,
reverently kissed the crucifix, and, returning to her
room, began to make her preparations.  She
caressed the lilac gown, as she unlaced it to
exchange it for the white satin and wedding
veil.  They should be her shroud, instead of her
bridal garments.

"Who knows but some happier, more fortunate
Euphemia D'Esterre, may wear this beloved
gown?  If so, I pray that it may bless her
with all that has been denied me."

It rustled softly, fell away from her to the
floor in a shimmering heap, and—

When my friends found me I lay in the rustic
chair unconscious, with the dew-wet mimosa
drooping over me; but when I regained the
power of rational thought and speech, it was
after a week of delirious illness.  The
Magnoliaville physician said that it had been,
coming on for some time, and was the result of
overwrought nerves, aggravated by my exposure
on the lawn that night, and his explanation
was readily accepted, while my story of the lilac
gown and Euphemia D'Esterre's sad death was
set aside as a dream, or the ravings of fever.
Perhaps it was a dream, but I shall always have
doubts, and I shall always believe that old gown
imparted to me the secret of her death, and
brought back prosperity to the D'Esterres.

I wondered what had become of that box of
papers—if it had been destroyed, or if Uncle
Peter could have it in his possession.  That did
not seem probable, still I determined to make
sure, and one evening, when my mother left me
alone in the sitting-room, I stole away through
the garden to Uncle Peter's cabin.  My sudden
appearance startled him, and without giving
him time to recover, I sternly said:

"Uncle Peter, where is that box of papers?"

A cunning gleam shot into his eyes.

"What yo' talkin' 'bout, honey?"

"The papers Euphemia's father left."

"What yo' know 'bout dem, Miss Phemy?
Did—did yo' see 'er too?"  The thought
sending an ashen hue to his face.

"Yes, I saw her," I said, solemnly.

He groaned.

"Honey, hit wus fo' Marse Albert's sake.  I
tuk en kep' 'em so ez 'e couldn't fine 'em when
'is pa died."  He looked at me imploringly.
"Let 'em be, honey—let 'em be."

"Give them to me, Uncle Peter," I said gently,
but firmly.

Tremblingly he lifted a loose stone from the
hearth, and brought up a small black box, the
same that I had seen under the hands of old
Gaston D'Esterre, in that midnight vision.  I
did not heed Uncle Peter's moans and ejaculations,
but, getting down on my knees, turned
the key in the rusty lock.  For half a century
and more this faithful servant had hidden the
evidence of his old master's wrong-doing.  But
I ruthlessly poured out letters and papers, some
of them with seals unbroken—letters written
by Euphemia and her lover, and intercepted
by the crafty Daniel—papers bearing false
witness to Herman Vandala's guilt, and last of all,
a brief, remorseful confession from Gaston
D'Esterre.  They were all yellow and musty,
and rustled in my shaking fingers, as I turned
them over in the light of the pine-knot fire
blazing on the hearth.

"Where did you get these, Uncle Peter?" I
asked at last.

"De Lawd forgive me, chile, I *stole* 'em, en
tuk en hid 'em while ole marse lay a-dyin' en
a-tellin' Marse Albert whar to fine 'em.  I 'feered
to burn 'em, but I kep' 'em, kase dey might fall
inter de wrong han's."

There were footsteps on the garden walk, the
doorway framed my mother's black-draped
figure and pale, frightened face.

"Phemie, child, what are you doing?"

"Unearthing old secrets," I said.

Beyond her I saw Herman Vandala, and,
sweeping the papers together in my hands, rose
up.  I held them out to him, trembling,
burning with shame, yet determined to right that
old wrong at any cost.

"Proofs of your uncle's innocence that I have
just discovered—I—"

He took them, and, with scarcely a glance,
threw them over my shoulder into the fire.
They caught like tinder, and for a moment the
small room was brilliantly illuminated, then
only a charred, blackened heap of ashes
remained to tell us of that old romance.  I
covered my face with my hands, but he drew them
away.

"We will not intermeddle with the past.
Restitution cannot be made in this world,
unless—is it generous to say?—unless you will be
my wife.  Let this Herman Vandala have the
happiness his kinsman was cheated out of.  I
love you.  I have been loving you faithfully for
years.  Your mother knows and consents.  Come
to me, Phemie, dearest, come."

My mother smiled tearfully upon us; but
Uncle Peter stared at the charred remnants of
the secret he had kept so long, muttering:

"Bress de Lawd, dey's gone!  Dey weighed
heavy on my soul—heavy.  I knowed sumfin
'ud happen when I seed Miss Euphemy t'other
night steppin' soft on de stairs, en in dat laylock
gown; yes, dat same laylock gown."
